---------00:00----------
all right we're gonna get started a nice

---------00:01----------
Friday night MacBook Board repair here

---------00:04----------
we got an eight two zero zero zero one

---------00:06----------
six floor board that appears to have the

---------00:09----------
problem of no power

---------00:11----------
let's first confirm the issue that they

---------00:13----------
claim which is that it doesn't power on

---------00:15----------
looks like on this MacBook the battery

---------00:17----------
has been lifted a little bit the DCN

---------00:19----------
board is unplugged all things that I'm

---------00:22----------
not exactly happy and excited to see on

---------00:23----------
a MacBook before it comes here what did

---------00:26----------
they do to you little MacBook who hurt

---------00:29----------
you

---------00:29----------
alright so it doesn't turn on and it

---------00:31----------
takes 16 milli amps of my power supply

---------00:34----------
reflow SMC then give it to Paul right

---------00:37----------
that's not what we're doing yeah that

---------00:39----------
sounds like a terrible idea we don't do

---------00:41----------
that on this channel I don't know what

---------00:42----------
you're talking about

---------00:43----------
that must be something new because that

---------00:45----------
just happened yesterday yeah that

---------00:48----------
doesn't happen here you must be watching

---------00:49----------
a different Channel all right let's see

---------00:52----------
what we have on this MacBook

---------01:15----------
no way there's no way I got this on the

---------01:20----------
void that's no way Steve put this in my

---------01:24----------
status no way what are the issues that

---------01:32----------
you have with how Steve sets the queue

---------01:35----------
well I got like six dead smc so far in

---------01:39----------
the last four days and I got this

---------01:44----------
capacity Paul what is Stephan putting in

---------01:46----------
your queue recently I had the same

---------01:48----------
capacitor on a on the same 11 inch air

---------01:53----------
earlier today so the queue is here's to

---------01:56----------
be working as intended new guy gets dead

---------02:02----------
SMC back to this air board so let's see

---------02:05----------
what this capacitors for you'll see that

---------02:07----------
this is C 74 30 this is a cap that sits

---------02:11----------
between PP bus s 5hs computing I sense

---------02:15----------
and ground this is used to smooth out

---------02:19----------
the that 8 point 5 volt rail before this

---------02:23----------
transistor in this buck converter

---------02:25----------
circuit here to makes PP 1 V 2 s 3 P P 1

---------02:28----------
V 2 s 3 is going to be a 1.2 volt power

---------02:31----------
line and that's going to be created by

---------02:32----------
this transistor and this chip switching

---------02:35----------
so here we have 8 volts right this is 8

---------02:38----------
volts now I transistor can turn on off

---------02:40----------
on off on off this chip over here is

---------02:43----------
going to control this transistor so

---------02:46----------
you're gonna get some 8 some zero some

---------02:48----------
of the 8 from up here and then it's

---------02:50----------
gonna close and you're gonna get 0 some

---------02:51----------
eight zero eight zero eight zero and

---------02:53----------
through this coil it's going to get

---------02:56----------
averaged out so instead of having a

---------02:57----------
bunch of eight and now a bunch of a

---------02:59----------
little bit of eight a bunch of zero a

---------03:00----------
little bit of eight a bunch of zero a

---------03:01----------
little bit of eight a bunch of zero

---------03:02----------
instead of having this waveform you're

---------03:04----------
just going to have it averaged out to

---------03:06----------
one point three volts and these

---------03:09----------
capacitors are going to provide the

---------03:11----------
smoothing down here now PP bus s 5hs

---------03:15----------
computing I sense is actually pp bus g3

---------03:19----------
hot now you may wonder why are there two

---------03:21----------
different names for this rail if it's

---------03:23----------
the same rail and that is a great

---------03:25----------
question that is going to confuse a lot

---------03:27----------
of people so let's take a look

---------03:29----------
over at our 5450 so what I just talked

---------03:33----------
about requires that you kind of

---------03:34----------
understand how a buck converter works I

---------03:36----------
would take a look at my basic

---------03:38----------
electronics video series and I'm a buck

---------03:39----------
converter works if you don't understand

---------03:40----------
that to understand why there's a

---------03:42----------
different name for P P bunch d3 hot when

---------03:44----------
it's on that side of the board you

---------03:45----------
should check out my current sensing

---------03:47----------
video from about three or four years ago

---------03:49----------
where I talked about how a current

---------03:50----------
sensing circuit works so P P bus g3 hot

---------03:53----------
over he's over here and it's going to go

---------03:55----------
through our 5450 before it becomes pp

---------03:58----------
bus s five high side I'm guessing high

---------04:00----------
side computing I sense before it becomes

---------04:03----------
this now on each side of this resistor

---------04:07----------
which is zero point zero zero two ohms

---------04:09----------
it's virtually no resistance at all on

---------04:11----------
each side of the resistor you have this

---------04:12----------
chip - that's right

---------04:14----------
you 5450 measuring the amount of current

---------04:17----------
me measuring the voltage at each side of

---------04:18----------
the resistor so it's gonna see how much

---------04:20----------
how much volts are here how many volts

---------04:22----------
are here how many volts not how much

---------04:24----------
volts that's that's dumb

---------04:25----------
if so you're gonna see how many volts

---------04:27----------
are on this side and how many volts are

---------04:29----------
on this side the greater the voltage

---------04:30----------
difference between these two sides the

---------04:33----------
more current is being used so that is a

---------04:35----------
way for the system to tell how much

---------04:36----------
current a specific part of the system is

---------04:38----------
using so for all intents and purposes I

---------04:40----------
like to consider that this capacitor

---------04:42----------
that we're looking at over here is on P

---------04:45----------
P bus g3 hot just to keep things simple

---------04:47----------
for me and that's that's just the way I

---------04:50----------
look at it in my head so all these

---------04:52----------
things that say pp bus underscore

---------04:54----------
something are typically on P P bus g3

---------04:56----------
hot so that cap is shorted to ground now

---------04:58----------
if we were to plug in my multimeter and

---------05:03----------
let's just pray that the Paul Daniel

---------05:06----------
software works today and see if I can

---------05:08----------
get that on the screen let's see what

---------05:10----------
voltage PP bus g3 hot winds up being we

---------05:13----------
get nothing

---------05:21----------
now I'm also going to check at the pp

---------05:23----------
bus g3 hot fuse where that rail is

---------05:25----------
directly created you get zero volts on

---------05:28----------
one side and 8.6 on the other so check

---------05:31----------
that out see zero volts on this side 8.6

---------05:35----------
on the other so if we look at the area

---------05:37----------
where PP bus g3 hot is actually created

---------05:39----------
at F 7 T 140 which is not far away this

---------05:42----------
is a fuse and this fuse is going to sit

---------05:45----------
between the circuit that creates PP but

---------05:49----------
g3 hot this is yet another buck

---------05:51----------
converter this is taking the 18 volts

---------05:53----------
from the charger and turning it into 8.6

---------05:55----------
volts for the system this is the fuse at

---------05:57----------
the end we get 8 volts on the left side

---------06:00----------
before the system and 0 on the right

---------06:02----------
side now if I were to check for a short

---------06:05----------
circuit to ground I bet we'd see one

---------06:07----------
time-warner is making your stream buffer

---------06:09----------
sure let me just call up Time Warner

---------06:12----------
tech support and have them fix that for

---------06:14----------
me while I'm doing the stream because

---------06:15----------
I'm confident that they're just gonna

---------06:16----------
fix my latency and make everything all

---------06:19----------
better again so we're gonna remove that

---------06:23----------
capacitor

---------06:39----------
you

---------06:56----------
alright that capacitor is off now we're

---------06:59----------
ready to wick the pads and install a

---------07:01----------
better one

---------07:33----------
load a new capacitor on there

---------08:04----------
in all its glory I already went on a

---------08:11----------
touch bar

---------08:19----------
you

---------08:25----------
I forgot which of the fuses on the desk

---------08:27----------
is the good one uh-oh my fuse fell on

---------08:34----------
the fan good luck

---------08:38----------
that's what I get for giving them a fuse

---------08:43----------
fuse now let's put that fuse on there

---------08:50----------
both Macbook generation can I recommend

---------08:53----------
my friends refuses to get anything else

---------08:54----------
is her facebook machine does your friend

---------08:57----------
really need to spend $1,200 to use

---------08:58----------
Facebook I have nothing to say to that

---------09:02----------
if you use a Mac because there a

---------09:05----------
specific audio software if you like

---------09:08----------
logic if there are certain plugins that

---------09:10----------
only work on Apple I can respect that if

---------09:13----------
you're saying I need to buy a MacBook

---------09:15----------
peak for my professional facebooking

---------09:17----------
just I have nothing to say to that I bet

---------09:24----------
we get fan spin fan spin
