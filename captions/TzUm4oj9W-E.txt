---------00:00----------
alright so today I'm going to be going

---------00:01----------
over another no backlight repair this is

---------00:03----------
a pretty annoying one it's been one

---------00:04----------
that's been driving me nuts for a while

---------00:07----------
I'm trying something different with the

---------00:08----------
video I'm trying out UT videos here's

---------00:11----------
one thing about open broadcaster if you

---------00:12----------
try to use 44 40 42 to capture it only

---------00:16----------
works if you use the built-in codec so

---------00:20----------
let me just show you some preference as

---------00:22----------
an open broadcaster here so I can show

---------00:24----------
you what I mean so if I'm an open

---------00:26----------
broadcaster right and I go to settings

---------00:28----------
when I go to output in advanced if I

---------00:31----------
choose instead of envy 12 which is 420

---------00:33----------
if I choose 444 and I go to output none

---------00:36----------
of these options and I do mean none of

---------00:38----------
them will work it just is brit's

---------00:40----------
inherently broken so yet if i go to

---------00:42----------
simple if i go over here and go standard

---------00:44----------
instead of advanced i can then record

---------00:46----------
using x264 and it works fine but that

---------00:48----------
mode doesn't allow me to output audio

---------00:50----------
and a codec of my choosing so it's a bit

---------00:53----------
of a pain in the ass and if you use RGB

---------00:55----------
over here it winds up using five times

---------00:57----------
the CPU in the file size is I 444 blah

---------00:59----------
blah so I'm trying this in NB 12 which

---------01:02----------
is 420 a little bit lower quality and UT

---------01:05----------
video which I can directly import into

---------01:07----------
vegas rather than having a trance code

---------01:08----------
so if this works I'll wind up with less

---------01:10----------
CPU usage less likelihood of going

---------01:12----------
out of sync and above all just be easier

---------01:14----------
all around so let me know if you think

---------01:16----------
the microscope quality looks crappy or

---------01:18----------
in this video I know that YouTube

---------01:19----------
doesn't even do anything over 420 so for

---------01:22----------
me recording 422 uncompressed is

---------01:25----------
probably admittedly going a little bit

---------01:27----------
overboard for the stem for this kind of

---------01:29----------
channel but anyway well it's I'm hoping

---------01:33----------
that that at least improves workflow a

---------01:34----------
little bit you know may be able to get

---------01:36----------
more stuff out if I can edit it quicker

---------01:38----------
and item not using up ridiculous amounts

---------01:40----------
of drive space so anyway this is the

---------01:43----------
backlight circuit so what's going on

---------01:45----------
with this board that's really pissing me

---------01:46----------
off is that I get back light for a quick

---------01:49----------
second when it turns on and then it

---------01:51----------
turns off and it's a board that I fixed

---------01:52----------
backlight issues on in the past yeah I

---------01:55----------
know I'm probably gonna get like 90

---------01:57----------
troublesome haha I knew your pants

---------01:59----------
didn't last yes everybody deals with

---------02:02----------
warranty even me so I have to go through

---------02:09----------
and figure out why this doesn't want to

---------02:10----------
work but first I have to figure out why

---------02:13----------
it doesn't

---------02:14----------
one two one two this is literally a

---------02:18----------
board from hell it's dead I know what I

---------02:22----------
said I know I said it started with no

---------02:23----------
backlight but it's dead so let's

---------02:25----------
just go over something real quick here

---------02:27----------
with the worst world's worst

---------02:28----------
troubleshooting camera angle tp3 v42 is

---------02:33----------
supposed to be three-point 42 volts it's

---------02:34----------
a power are responsible for the one wire

---------02:36----------
circuit which was responsible for a

---------02:37----------
green light in the charger pp3 v42 is 1

---------02:41----------
point 6 volts and 1.6 now input to the

---------02:47----------
circuit is 16 volts the resistor that's

---------02:50----------
supposed to limit current going into the

---------02:52----------
circuit in case of a fault to give me 16

---------02:55----------
on one side three on the other which

---------02:57----------
means that before I even started

---------02:59----------
literally before I even started

---------03:01----------
troubleshooting the damn bored it died

---------03:04----------
like it yeah this is this going to be

---------03:08----------
one of those days this is going to be

---------03:10----------
one of those days I'm going to spend all

---------03:11----------
day on one piece of crap alright

---------03:14----------
so let's put this aside for now put it

---------03:17----------
aside soya out of sight out of mind in

---------03:22----------
my tiny little office and the chair

---------03:23----------
that's sitting next to me and do one

---------03:26----------
thing at a time this is something that's

---------03:30----------
worth getting we went to quit with it

---------03:32----------
comes to these things in life so many

---------03:34----------
people they get up they see a problem

---------03:36----------
and then another problem another problem

---------03:37----------
and I guess this is one thing I've

---------03:39----------
noticed while I've been trying to get a

---------03:41----------
trainee so I've been saying for a while

---------03:42----------
now that I want to replace myself at my

---------03:44----------
business and one of the things that just

---------03:46----------
gets me about trainees as they screw up

---------03:48----------
one thing and it's like but they don't

---------03:51----------
get something and then it's

---------03:57----------
it's the look it's always the look it's

---------03:59----------
always the look that you know they're

---------04:02----------
just little discouragement then I try to

---------04:03----------
do it in a reasonable fashion I try to

---------04:06----------
kind of feed people like I try to feed

---------04:08----------
people these little successes but even

---------04:11----------
if you feed them little successes like

---------04:12----------
the first time they fail it's just this

---------04:14----------
huge discouragement do this it's

---------04:17----------
annoying and you can tell which one of

---------04:19----------
these resistors is the blown one which

---------04:21----------
one you are you you were you one of

---------04:26----------
these friggin days but

---------04:38----------
I mean it like this this sucks of course

---------04:40----------
I mean it's an issue that I haven't had

---------04:41----------
in a long time and to start off the

---------04:43----------
issue starting off we have a totally

---------04:46----------
unrelated issue that has nothing to do

---------04:49----------
with anything that I've done something

---------04:51----------
just decides to blow just to be a dick

---------04:52----------
just to be an you know and what

---------04:56----------
I like am I gonna go nope I'm gonna

---------05:00----------
solve it not only am I going to solve it

---------05:03----------
I'm gonna solve it on camera and have

---------05:05----------
this board be made humble old country

---------05:08----------
way as Iron Sheik would say Iron Sheik

---------05:10----------
OH is used to like to say that he would

---------05:12----------
make something humble old country way I

---------05:15----------
try to fix boards the same way that Iron

---------05:17----------
Sheik would wrestle and I know there was

---------05:20----------
a hair there but I moved it out of the

---------05:21----------
way so this board will be made humble as

---------05:29----------
humble as can be oh my god Lois you

---------05:37----------
pulling a resistor off the counter part

---------05:40----------
yep yes repair police can get me yes

---------06:10----------
melty piece of excellent go on a

---------06:16----------
place your piece of excellent

---------06:40----------
elbow

---------06:54----------
hmm

---------07:13----------
factory mo'fucker now

---------07:21----------
are we back to where we started

---------07:32----------
we're back to where we started it's not

---------07:35----------
dead now we go over this backlight

---------07:37----------
 all right now we set ourselves

---------07:41----------
up for some quiet and also some thinking

---------07:44----------
so when we look up here at the PDF now

---------07:49----------
with the issue that I have with this

---------07:50----------
board is that the back light will come

---------07:52----------
on for a second and then turn off or

---------07:54----------
should give me half back light and all

---------07:55----------
sorts of really silly odd things that

---------07:58----------
don't make any sense in the context of

---------08:00----------
what I'm used to fixing so I tap the

---------08:02----------
board out of the computer i'm going to

---------08:03----------
plug the screen into the computer and

---------08:04----------
i'm going to have the board flipped over

---------08:06----------
so that i can measure a different parts

---------08:08----------
in the back light circuit and show you

---------08:09----------
what's going on so without further ado

---------08:13----------
I'm going to turn it on and we're going

---------08:15----------
to measure what's going on at different

---------08:17----------
points so one of the first points that

---------08:18----------
I'm really interested in is I'm

---------08:20----------
interested in measuring and back light

---------08:21----------
output I want to know the voltage and

---------08:23----------
getting on output because that's going

---------08:24----------
to set the stage for all my future

---------08:26----------
troubleshooting all my theories are

---------08:27----------
going to be based on what I see at

---------08:29----------
output first things first I have to wait

---------08:32----------
for this POS to turn on because all

---------08:35----------
these machines when you do an RTC race

---------08:37----------
if he said they turn on off on off on

---------08:38----------
off and then finally on again all the

---------08:40----------
2013 14 15 airs

---------08:58----------
alright so it's on and back light output

---------09:02----------
is nothing back light fuses 8 volts on

---------09:09----------
one side and 8 volts on the other so

---------09:13----------
most likely it doesn't even see that

---------09:15----------
there is a screen connected to the

---------09:17----------
computer so we're going to try again and

---------09:20----------
just make sure that didn't come

---------09:20----------
unplugged I'm going to unplug the

---------09:22----------
Machine unplug it turn it back and plug

---------09:24----------
it back in and let's see so if you have

---------09:29----------
zero volts on back light output and is

---------09:30----------
not a break in the line usually what it

---------09:32----------
means is that this transistor over here

---------09:34----------
is not opening and it's not opening

---------09:35----------
because it doesn't have because this

---------09:38----------
voltage divider is not working so this

---------09:39----------
voltage divider over here is going to

---------09:41----------
put lower voltage on the gate than on

---------09:44----------
the source which will allow power to

---------09:45----------
flow now this voltage divider will only

---------09:47----------
work if it as a path to ground this

---------09:49----------
voltage divider will only have a path to

---------09:50----------
ground of these two transistors which

---------09:52----------
are n-channel have voltage in the gate

---------09:54----------
which allows them to open I've gone over

---------09:56----------
this in many previous videos that's

---------09:57----------
confusing go over my videos and how it

---------09:59----------
transistor works now this signal over

---------10:01----------
here UDP backlight enable is not going

---------10:03----------
to work it's not going to pass anything

---------10:06----------
it's not going to do anything if it

---------10:08----------
doesn't see a panel so now I have 17

---------10:10----------
volts on back light output and that

---------10:12----------
gives me a thing is it's what this tells

---------10:15----------
me is that it tried to boost it puts him

---------10:17----------
honest effort in to try to boost and

---------10:18----------
then it failed I'm kind of curious as to

---------10:20----------
why it failed so first thing we're going

---------10:22----------
to do is we're going to check over here

---------10:23----------
at backlight enable his bag does the

---------10:25----------
backlight enables supposed to be around

---------10:27----------
2.7 2.5 2.7 volts and let's see what we

---------10:32----------
get over here so backlight enable should

---------10:35----------
be I get to point a volts all right now

---------10:39----------
we check be a backlight pwm backlight

---------10:42----------
pwm is going to be what sets brightness

---------10:44----------
so i'm interested in the seeing that

---------10:46----------
because if even if it's being told to

---------10:48----------
enable and turn on if it's not giving me

---------10:51----------
brightness brightness signal then I know

---------10:53----------
it's not going to turn on the light if

---------10:54----------
you turn the brightness all the way down

---------10:55----------
on your keyboard it's not going to turn

---------10:57----------
on regardless of the fact that the

---------10:58----------
machines on so let's just open the board

---------11:00----------
view here love this new open Boyd view

---------11:02----------
software it's so awesome I was so cheap

---------11:05----------
I didn't I wasn't going to pay for this

---------11:06----------
like I feel bad saying that it's just a

---------11:08----------
lot of people messaged me before this

---------11:10----------
thing was made

---------11:11----------
they said you know would you I would

---------11:13----------
like to code this what do you think this

---------11:14----------
is worth it's like I know that I've

---------11:15----------
complained about it a million times but

---------11:17----------
it is one of those things where I would

---------11:19----------
just rather cursed and pay 100 to 200 or

---------11:21----------
500 foot board view software so I never

---------11:22----------
did but this now that it's finally

---------11:25----------
released I love it alright so let's see

---------11:28----------
so backlight enable is present but

---------11:30----------
backlight pwm is set to zero now I want

---------11:33----------
you to think about this I want you to

---------11:35----------
think about this real hard what do you

---------11:36----------
think is going to set the backlight pwm

---------11:39----------
to be low what do you think is going to

---------11:41----------
tell this to have the lowest brightness

---------11:42----------
at all times one of the things that's

---------11:44----------
going to tell it to have the lowest

---------11:45----------
brightness at all times is something

---------11:47----------
called the smc lid signal so the smc lid

---------11:50----------
signal is a signal that tells the

---------11:52----------
machine that you have closed it when you

---------11:54----------
close the lid on a laptop it turns

---------11:56----------
itself off it doesn't know what means it

---------11:59----------
turns the backlight off because if

---------12:01----------
you've closed the lid and the lid you

---------12:04----------
know tells it to go to sleep and there's

---------12:07----------
a let's see now in the old schematics it

---------12:09----------
would tell you which voltage for smc lid

---------12:11----------
means what but they don't do that

---------12:15----------
anymore so let's find an older schematic

---------12:17----------
because on the older ones that will make

---------12:18----------
a little bit more sense so this is one

---------12:20----------
for an older macbook pro if I keep

---------12:23----------
searching around on the smc lid signal

---------12:25----------
here we go so eventually you'll get to a

---------12:27----------
little part of the document like this

---------12:29----------
when the lid is click lid open smc lid 3

---------12:32----------
point 4 volts lid closed smc lid is

---------12:36----------
lower than point 5 volts okay that's

---------12:39----------
easy enough alright so let's see smc

---------12:42----------
underscore lid where can I find the lid

---------12:44----------
switch okay I can find it right over

---------12:47----------
here on one two three four me okay

---------12:49----------
this resistor smc you lid so I'm going

---------12:52----------
to measure that signal with the machine

---------12:55----------
half out on my Jesus this sucks okay can

---------12:59----------
I reach my microscope out this far

---------13:00----------
mm-hmm so I have the machine over here

---------13:04----------
of course right out of reach yeah and

---------13:09----------
see I have the Machine turned around so

---------13:12----------
that I could have the screen plugged in

---------13:13----------
but also measure it well that's not a

---------13:16----------
nice sound poor fan I'm sorry fam I'm

---------13:19----------
sorry

---------13:21----------
can we get you under the microscope of

---------13:26----------
course you're just at a rich you month

---------13:30----------
mother flower all right let's see okay

---------13:36----------
so we're looking for 123 we're looking

---------13:38----------
for the sixth resistor and of course

---------13:43----------
it's too low as well go figure I'll lift

---------13:45----------
a microscope up a little on here feels

---------13:48----------
you may ask why I got rid of that

---------13:49----------
articulating one well I didn't get rid

---------13:51----------
of it I use it at the other station for

---------13:53----------
the students and the reason I don't use

---------13:55----------
it for myself is because it moves back

---------13:58----------
and forth a lot and it makes me dizzy

---------14:00----------
the whole idea with the articulating

---------14:02----------
stands that it's very easy to move

---------14:03----------
around without having a you know D

---------14:05----------
tighten things so smc lid is a straight

---------14:11----------
up zero volts which means that hmm now

---------14:16----------
this is interesting to me actually no

---------14:18----------
it's not I didn't have my ground touch

---------14:19----------
time on crack smc lid is 3.2 33 volts

---------14:25----------
hmm but it should be ah I feel like that

---------14:32----------
should be higher 3.22 hmm something

---------14:44----------
pulling down the lid switch

---------14:51----------
you know what I'm going to try here I'm

---------14:53----------
going to try my own DC and board just

---------14:56----------
out of curiosity because the smc lid

---------14:58----------
switch usually comes from the DC

---------15:00----------
employed so I'm kind of curious if I get

---------15:03----------
a different result when I use my own DC

---------15:05----------
on board so the dcn board is a board on

---------15:08----------
the left side of the machine that is on

---------15:11----------
this model what's going to read the

---------15:14----------
screen when I say read the screen what I

---------15:16----------
mean is that when you close the lid when

---------15:18----------
you close the screen there's a magnet in

---------15:20----------
it and the and it trips a switch inside

---------15:24----------
the dcn board that tells the machine hey

---------15:26----------
you the user has closed the lid so then

---------15:29----------
it knows to assert that switch the smc

---------15:32----------
let's start that signal that smc lid

---------15:34----------
signal which is then going to put the

---------15:36----------
computer to sleep so I'm kind of curious

---------15:39----------
am I troubleshooting a backlight circuit

---------15:40----------
issue when in reality I should be

---------15:42----------
troubleshooting an smc lid issue

---------15:58----------
yep

---------16:00----------
I have a light so I was trouble shooting

---------16:04----------
the wrong thing now I do I have a light

---------16:07----------
but I have a pretty light you want to

---------16:09----------
see my pretty light check out my pretty

---------16:12----------
light oh well as you can see the light

---------16:16----------
kind of went off because I I was

---------16:19----------
bragging about it okay so maybe that's

---------16:21----------
not it seriously really really really

---------16:27----------
okay so the light dimmed

---------16:38----------
I wanted to dim because it hasn't had

---------16:40----------
activity in a while or well first thing

---------16:43----------
I want to do here is let's see what the

---------16:44----------
SMC lid voltage is with my different dcn

---------16:48----------
board just to see if anything changed

---------16:50----------
Alex silly curiosity call me crazy so if

---------16:56----------
I were to measure SMC lid voltage with

---------16:58----------
my different dcn board you know the

---------17:05----------
different dcn board SMC lid is a

---------17:06----------
straight-up 3.41 to it's not 3.2 so it's

---------17:10----------
a little bit different on some of these

---------17:11----------
machines so over here it says on the

---------17:13----------
schematic for the older machine lid open

---------17:16----------
smc lid three-point 42 when the lid is

---------17:19----------
closed smc lid is going to be below 0

---------17:21----------
point 5 but in reality even if the

---------17:23----------
signals even if smc lid is is 3.2 it

---------17:29----------
still causes me to have intermittency

---------17:31----------
and things like backlight yes i'm still

---------17:35----------
at 3.41 too now I'm just going to plug

---------17:39----------
in the keyboard and all that good stuff

---------17:41----------
with this different dcn board and see

---------17:44----------
what I get ok and as you can see here

---------17:50----------
got myself a light got myself a light so

---------17:55----------
the original issue with this board which

---------17:56----------
was repaired off-camera long time ago

---------17:59----------
was the backlight circle was burned by

---------18:01----------
liquid but now the backlight circuit was

---------18:03----------
physically burned I fixed that a long

---------18:05----------
time later it then comes back with a no

---------18:07----------
backlight now the no but I thought man

---------18:09----------
kya up preparing the backlight

---------18:11----------
circuit maybe I screwed up fixing the

---------18:13----------
backlight sir maybe there's something

---------18:14----------
wrong with what i fixed of course is

---------18:16----------
nothing wrong with what i fixed i'm

---------18:17----------
perfect i'm waiting for my ceiling a

---------18:20----------
fall on me if there's any woman for God

---------18:23----------
because the ceiling a fall on me right

---------18:24----------
now would be the perfect opportune time

---------18:26----------
as I said I shouldn't say like that

---------18:28----------
out loud I'm going to get struck by

---------18:29----------
lightning but the whole idea here was

---------18:32----------
that something else a secondary issue

---------18:34----------
existed which then caused a symptom of

---------18:37----------
the primary issue so the secondary issue

---------18:39----------
didn't recalls the primary issue it

---------18:40----------
didn't cause the backlight circuit to

---------18:42----------
become burned again but the symptom of

---------18:44----------
the backlight circuit being burned or

---------18:46----------
ism is the fact that I you know had no

---------18:47----------
backlight now the smc lid switch being

---------18:50----------
lower than its supposed to be

---------18:52----------
also causes no backlight so it only I I

---------18:55----------
went back to my primary defect before I

---------18:57----------
started thinking wait a second what

---------18:59----------
would cause the PWM signal below again

---------19:01----------
this is all about following logic so I I

---------19:03----------
go back through my back light circuit I

---------19:05----------
go back to my back light circuit and I

---------19:08----------
say alright the enable signal is there

---------19:10----------
it has the capability to boost I saw you

---------19:12----------
go up to 25 volts so I know that this

---------19:14----------
has the ability to boost it has the

---------19:16----------
ability to boost but it's not boosting

---------19:18----------
its being told to enable but it's not

---------19:21----------
enabling but the PWM signal is missing

---------19:23----------
and when you google LP 8550 and you find

---------19:25----------
the data sheet you'll see that pwm is

---------19:28----------
going to be what sets display brightness

---------19:29----------
again when I first saw bikal boom might

---------19:31----------
I don't know what the of Bickle

---------19:32----------
pumas you know sounds like some foreign

---------19:35----------
porn so but when I searched for LP 8550

---------19:38----------
I get a data sheet from Texas

---------19:40----------
Instruments this is the backlight pwm is

---------19:42----------
going to be a pwm that sets the

---------19:44----------
brightness you know so i check and

---------19:47----------
there's nothing there so i know that the

---------19:49----------
machine is the capability to boost it on

---------19:50----------
my circuit has the ability to boost for

---------19:52----------
some reason the system is telling the

---------19:54----------
backlight driver to lower the backlight

---------19:56----------
the backlight voltage to the lowest

---------19:58----------
possible state so why would it do that

---------20:01----------
and then I have to think to myself this

---------20:02----------
is where you have to be it took this is

---------20:03----------
because this this is one of the things

---------20:04----------
that I tell people who come here there

---------20:06----------
are some people that there are some

---------20:08----------
people that want they really need to

---------20:10----------
know that there is when there's no

---------20:12----------
backlight I replace this chip and it

---------20:14----------
works again they think that this is what

---------20:15----------
it is and I wind up traumatizing

---------20:17----------
them when I walk them through these

---------20:18----------
repairs you have to become a detective

---------20:20----------
so my back light circuit has the ability

---------20:22----------
to boost check it's being told to turn

---------20:25----------
on enable check receiving voltage at the

---------20:28----------
VN pin of the backlight driver check but

---------20:31----------
the section that says the brightness is

---------20:32----------
all the way down what in the machine

---------20:34----------
would cause the brightness to be all the

---------20:36----------
way down what if I close the lid and

---------20:38----------
then we look up the lid switch what's

---------20:40----------
the lid supposed to be osm seal it is

---------20:42----------
supposed to be 3.42 when its open and

---------20:45----------
for some reason is 3.2 now again the

---------20:48----------
manual here it says that the u.s. when

---------20:50----------
smc lid is below point 5 volts then it

---------20:54----------
will assume that the lid is closed but

---------20:56----------
in reality even if the smc lid signal is

---------20:59----------
much higher than point 5 volts Thank You

---------21:02----------
 Apple documentation

---------21:05----------
por q my I would love to see great i

---------21:07----------
under if exports again I would pay like

---------21:09----------
if his patreon had like five thousand a

---------21:12----------
month and it was fixed boards there's a

---------21:14----------
good chance I'd consider giving it

---------21:15----------
because like I think that would be the

---------21:16----------
funniest no we're all just watching

---------21:18----------
those two little stick figures go

---------21:19----------
through all this but yeah the Apple

---------21:21----------
documentation says 3.4 T 2 volts means

---------21:23----------
that the lid is open and below point 5

---------21:26----------
volts means the lid is closed but in

---------21:28----------
reality if the lid is even off by eight

---------21:32----------
 percent it will screw with the

---------21:35----------
system the system was not going to sleep

---------21:37----------
it wasn't going to sleep but the lid

---------21:40----------
switch being low is causing the

---------21:41----------
backlight to go to go if he so I think

---------21:43----------
what's going on here is even if the

---------21:46----------
system even if the system is is still in

---------21:49----------
an awake state because whatever it is

---------21:52----------
that the text whether or not to go to

---------21:53----------
sleep wants to see it at point five or

---------21:55----------
below I think the backlight circuit is

---------21:57----------
set up to where the PWM signal is going

---------22:00----------
to go down if it sees the lid switch is

---------22:03----------
any is even off three percent from where

---------22:05----------
it's supposed to be so yeah literally

---------22:07----------
bad DC and bored up my back

---------22:11----------
light circuit and wasting my morning

---------22:13----------
 you my man Howard i would pay so

---------22:17----------
much money to watch grade-a under a fix

---------22:19----------
a motherboard that would be that would

---------22:21----------
be like the entertainment for the

---------22:23----------
century for me anyway with that said I

---------22:25----------
hope you learn something
