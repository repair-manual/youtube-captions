---------00:00----------
hey everybody how's it going it looks

---------00:02----------
like you're all here and ready to work

---------00:03----------
so today we're gonna be working on

---------00:05----------
another MacBook here we have in a 1278

---------00:09----------
board this is the 8 to 0

---------00:11----------
- 31 15 it has a top-of-the-line Ivy

---------00:16----------
Bridge processor it has a 1280 by 800

---------00:19----------
high resolution screen it has support

---------00:22----------
for up to 16 gigabytes of RAM it comes

---------00:25----------
fully featured with a 500 gigabyte 5400

---------00:28----------
rpm hard drive and in 2016 this piece of

---------00:32----------
garbage with a dual-core Ivy Bridge CPU

---------00:34----------
I five not even i7 still sold for $1,050

---------00:39----------
plus tax

---------00:40----------
Apple anyway so let's get started on

---------00:44----------
this beauty what's going on with this

---------00:46----------
lovely machine is that it does not

---------00:48----------
appear to be turning on like it's

---------00:50----------
supposed to so first thing we're gonna

---------00:51----------
do over here is plug in the DCN board

---------00:55----------
and this DC and board is a little

---------00:57----------
sticker on it that appears to indicate

---------00:58----------
that it is not the original DC and board

---------01:02----------
so maybe somebody was trying to solve

---------01:04----------
their problem and as you can see we have

---------01:07----------
no green light on the charger now the

---------01:10----------
first thing that we need to get a green

---------01:12----------
light on the charger is a power rail

---------01:14----------
called pp3 before - so let's find out

---------01:17----------
where that is so we should be able to

---------01:18----------
find that right here now what's our pp 3

---------01:21----------
d4 - what is our pp 3 V 4 - 3 point 5

---------01:25----------
volts very good it's exactly what's

---------01:29----------
expected now next thing we have to do is

---------01:32----------
see if the SMC is running

---------01:39----------
and we do that by checking peepee bus g3

---------01:42----------
hot peepee bus g3 hot is one of the

---------01:45----------
system's main power rails peepee bus g3

---------01:47----------
hot is created by the u 7000 ship

---------01:50----------
how would that tell me if the SMC is

---------01:51----------
running you ask well great question you

---------01:55----------
7000 has a data line with the system

---------01:57----------
management controller that can be seen

---------01:59----------
right here it's a bi-directional data

---------02:01----------
line and if that data line is not

---------02:04----------
working because the SMC is not running

---------02:06----------
instead of producing 12 point 56 volts

---------02:08----------
on PP bus g3 hot it will produce 12

---------02:11----------
point 23 volts on PP bus g3 hot and as

---------02:15----------
you can see we're getting something

---------02:17----------
close to 12 point 23 volts on PP bus g3

---------02:19----------
hot which means that our system

---------02:21----------
management controller is not running

---------02:23----------
let's figure out what turns on our

---------02:24----------
system management controller and see if

---------02:26----------
that's what's causing our issue let's

---------02:27----------
take a look at the SMC reset circuit the

---------02:30----------
SMC reset circuit is going to send out a

---------02:32----------
signal called

---------02:32----------
SMC underscore reset underscore l

---------02:34----------
underscore l stands for low meaning when

---------02:37----------
the voltage on the signal is low then

---------02:39----------
the prefix is going to be true so the s

---------02:43----------
the purpose of the signal is to reset

---------02:45----------
the SMC when it is low when it is zero

---------02:48----------
volts when the signal is high the SMC

---------02:51----------
will no longer be in reset mode think of

---------02:53----------
reset mode like what happens when you

---------02:54----------
reset your computer or when you hold the

---------02:57----------
reset button down if you have a standard

---------02:59----------
traditional desktop PC and you hold down

---------03:01----------
the reset button it's on but the PC is

---------03:04----------
never really starting and the same is

---------03:05----------
true of the SMC this chip is kind of

---------03:07----------
like a brownout detector it's going to

---------03:09----------
ensure that the SMC weights about a

---------03:12----------
quarter of a second before it turns on

---------03:14----------
so that the PP 3v4 to rail has a second

---------03:17----------
to stabilize now let's just check it out

---------03:20----------
SMC reset l and see where we can find

---------03:23----------
that SMC reset l is gonna be present on

---------03:26----------
this chip over here so let's see if that

---------03:29----------
is present when I measure and it's not

---------03:33----------
0.2 volts we have two possibilities here

---------03:37----------
behind three possible another one the

---------03:40----------
pull-up resistor here at our 5000 is

---------03:44----------
corroded and as a result this signal is

---------03:47----------
not being created behind door number two

---------03:49----------
the SMC reset IC is bad and

---------03:52----------
permanently holding the signal down

---------03:54----------
behind door number Paul the SMC is dead

---------03:58----------
it needs to be replaced with another one

---------04:00----------
that is guaranteed to be good off of a

---------04:01----------
six year old donor board which good luck

---------04:02----------
finding that I'm hoping that it's number

---------04:05----------
one or number two one way to find out

---------04:07----------
so let's inspect let's go based on

---------04:09----------
what's easiest before me the easiest

---------04:12----------
thing to do is to check our 5,000

---------04:13----------
second-hardest replace you fifty ten

---------04:16----------
third heart is SMC so let's take a look

---------04:20----------
at where our five thousand is on this

---------04:21----------
donor board on this little little

---------04:24----------
MacBook and that's on the other side of

---------04:28----------
the board do keep in mind that that

---------04:30----------
would make for the easiest repair so

---------04:32----------
we're just going to look on the other

---------04:33----------
side of this MacBook and see if I have

---------04:35----------
the easiest repair which would be great

---------04:38----------
random remember all MacBooks fixed on

---------04:42----------
camera are picked at random well folks

---------05:02----------
that's a lot of dog fur cat hair

---------05:08----------
can you see the pull-up resistor it's

---------05:12----------
right here here

---------05:28----------
yeah

---------05:37----------
let's zoom into the heart of that

---------05:38----------
corrosion so happens and you spill

---------05:44----------
liquid on your MacBook mofo let's go

---------05:50----------
into the heart of that corrosion yeah

---------05:55----------
isn't that sexy

---------05:59----------
that's your MacBook baby

---------06:12----------
dog fur and random green is not a

---------06:14----------
proper conductor of electricity time to

---------06:17----------
fix this board we're gonna use some flux

---------06:20----------
some hot air just add a little bit of

---------06:23----------
flux over here

---------06:33----------
and get this garbage off of my board

---------07:32----------
the bad resistor has been removed from

---------07:34----------
the MacBook the filthy dog hair has been

---------07:37----------
burned and smells like such in my office

---------07:41----------
isn't it a joy to work in this industry

---------07:45----------
now we're gonna do is we're gonna fix

---------07:48----------
that broken pad as can be seen over here

---------07:51----------
they're supposed to be a pad where PP 3

---------07:53----------
v 4 - is it going to pull up the SMC

---------07:55----------
reset L signal and that PP 3 V 4 to pad

---------07:59----------
that we would expect to be right over

---------08:01----------
here

---------08:01----------
his nut is missing it is not present and

---------08:06----------
that is not going to help us so we are

---------08:08----------
going to scrape away and see if we can

---------08:10----------
bring back a happy little solder pad

---------08:21----------
we're just gonna scrape scrape

---------08:36----------
scrape

---------08:39----------
scrape

---------08:44----------
scrape

---------09:00----------
scrape

---------09:12----------
scrape scrape good

---------09:26----------
[Music]

---------09:34----------
great now my flux container has dog hair

---------09:39----------
on it yeah

---------10:55----------
it's gonna bulldoze this whole area

---------10:59----------
disgusting disgusting trash

---------12:14----------
all right little MacBook time for this

---------12:23----------
little MacBook to become a PC

---------13:15----------
how does a boy get so much dog hair dog

---------13:20----------
I had to guess probably a dog

---------14:49----------
now we're gonna see if we get a green

---------14:51----------
light in the charger and the

---------14:53----------
ever-important fans spin this is a fan

---------15:01----------
this is how you can see if it spins

---------15:19----------
I'm little MacBook

---------15:25----------
little MacBook nope let's check my ass

---------15:31----------
and see you reset first let's check my

---------15:38----------
peepee three before to present SMC reset

---------15:43----------
2.9 what hmm

---------15:49----------
let's poke around my ass MC reset area a

---------15:52----------
little bit so you're aware my peepee 3

---------15:55----------
before 2 is aha

---------16:00----------
pp 3 before 2 is not making it to this

---------16:02----------
section of the board

---------16:03----------
that's like half assed pp 3 before - all

---------16:08----------
right so we got to run a jumper

---------16:09----------
so pp 3 before 2 is not making it to

---------16:12----------
that section of the board over here so

---------16:14----------
where's the nearest place that I can

---------16:15----------
grab our pp 3 V 4 2 from it looks like

---------16:18----------
this capacitor over here so we're gonna

---------16:20----------
run a wire between this capacitor and

---------16:22----------
this part of the board repeat P 3 before

---------16:24----------
it too is supposed to be but isn't let's

---------16:27----------
find that capacitor that capacitor is

---------16:30----------
going to be right here and let's get

---------16:38----------
ourselves a little piece of wire first

---------16:41----------
thing we're gonna do is tin that little

---------16:43----------
capacitor now we're gonna run a wire

---------16:46----------
it's gonna be great

---------17:00----------
see what I did there I noticed SMC reset

---------17:04----------
was low but it wasn't totally gone so I

---------17:07----------
went to where the signal was created and

---------17:08----------
then I went to see if the pull up

---------17:09----------
resistor creating the signal was low and

---------17:18----------
it was in that area because pp3 v4 - was

---------17:21----------
not fully present however in another

---------17:24----------
spot of the board pp3 v4 - seems to be

---------17:26----------
present just fine

---------18:01----------
let's attach a micro pencil to make the

---------18:03----------
job easier

---------18:17----------
much better micro pencil

---------18:34----------
the bigger the glob the better the job

---------18:36----------
is Paul s would always say

---------18:51----------
the bigger the glob the better the job

---------19:09----------
we're just gonna route that wire around

---------19:12----------
nicely in here there we go

---------19:15----------
cut off the excess over here

---------19:24----------
we're gonna turn this board around and

---------19:26----------
witness the beauty of fans bin glory

---------19:37----------
fans been greenlight working board

---------19:42----------
that's all there is to it folks it's

---------19:44----------
just that simple so we had a board over

---------19:48----------
here that didn't have a green light in

---------19:49----------
the charger we had PP three before two

---------19:51----------
but the issue wound up being that SMC

---------19:54----------
reset L was not present and the SMC was

---------19:56----------
not turning on the place where SMC reset

---------20:01----------
L is pulled up was corroded on the board

---------20:05----------
we went over here we went to the part

---------20:09----------
where it was supposed to be pulled up

---------20:10----------
where it was corroded and we replaced

---------20:13----------
the resistor and other things in the

---------20:15----------
area

---------20:15----------
the connection between PP 3 V 4 2 and

---------20:18----------
pin 1 of the resistor was damaged so he

---------20:20----------
found PP 3 V 4 to from another area on

---------20:22----------
the board and ran a jumper wire to it

---------20:25----------
after running a jump of wire to it it

---------20:27----------
worked we had green light and fan spin

---------20:30----------
hopefully you learned something and with

---------20:32----------
that we're gonna move on to the next

---------20:34----------
board if you want to get a board fix

---------20:37----------
just like this one just go to rossmann

---------20:39----------
group comm or send your MacBook comm

---------20:43----------
that send your MacBook calm don't delay

---------20:46----------
head to our website and give us money
