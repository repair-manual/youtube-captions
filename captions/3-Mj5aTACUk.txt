---------00:00----------
think all right let's start with the you

---------00:02----------
let me get the microscope and focus so

---------00:05----------
here we start with the firewire circuit

---------00:09----------
missing via here we now look we move on

---------00:14----------
destroyed RTC circuit area missing via

---------00:20----------
missing via for RTC so that's not gonna

---------00:22----------
PPV RTC is gonna be missing more PPV RTC

---------00:26----------
missing back light circuit missing

---------00:29----------
switch via Thunderbolt Thunderbolt

---------00:35----------
missing via missing probe point just

---------00:40----------
shorted capacitor the look the

---------00:42----------
transistor switch to turn on power for

---------00:44----------
Thunderbolt look at that

---------00:45----------
I think it's done der bolt of pp 1 v8s

---------00:47----------
so something like that but look at this

---------00:49----------
if it's something okay look at this gone

---------00:52----------
SMC corrosion everywhere corroded

---------00:56----------
resistor select see look sensor PP bus

---------01:01----------
sensor gone

---------01:03----------
it looks CPU vcore circuit missing watch

---------01:07----------
let's check out the CPU core second look

---------01:09----------
at this the CPU I MVP ton resistor what

---------01:13----------
is this what is this what did you do to

---------01:15----------
your MacBook no these free to acidotic

---------01:22----------
RAM voltage circuit check out RAM

---------01:24----------
voltage circuit corrosion corrosion but

---------01:29----------
this is the RAM voltage circuit is

---------01:30----------
actually the best of it is just a little

---------01:32----------
bit of mile corrosion feedback resistor

---------01:36----------
for the 3 for the 5 volt circuit qfn

---------01:39----------
package for the 5 volt circuit somewhat

---------01:42----------
destroyed via capacitor that's probably

---------01:44----------
not soldered on anymore not soldered

---------01:49----------
probably not resisting destroy capacitor

---------02:01----------
is l6 259 for creating ppbut g3 high

---------02:05----------
rune Pro points emiru prone point room

---------02:08----------
pro point room pro point rune pro point

---------02:10----------
rune pro point NV arun pro point and via

---------02:13----------
ruined resistor ruined capacitor ruin

---------02:15----------
drew two resistors for high side charger

---------02:17----------
current sensing ruined destroyed

---------02:19----------
resistor for battery current sensing

---------02:21----------
that's not even present anymore ruined

---------02:23----------
resistor for battery current sensing not

---------02:25----------
present anymore

---------02:26----------
Thunderbolt I think it's the Thunderbolt

---------02:28----------
MUX with under another Thunderbolt power

---------02:29----------
trip that is exploded and left a hole in

---------02:32----------
the motherboard PP 5 e s4 s3 capacitor

---------02:35----------
there destroyed let's check out the

---------02:37----------
audio circuit what is the ok the audio

---------02:40----------
circuits actually doing pretty good good

---------02:43----------
yeah they missed acid on the audio

---------02:45----------
circuit BP bus g3 hot fuse is almost

---------02:48----------
scraped off the board that solder is

---------02:50----------
completely malleable and our backlight

---------02:56----------
fuse back can't forget that backlight

---------02:58----------
fuse look at that where the solder fits

---------03:00----------
look at it it's totally Brown oh my good

---------03:02----------
there goes an RTC circuit house RTC

---------03:06----------
looking

---------03:07----------
show me the via for PPV RTC g3 huh where

---------03:12----------
a system RTC reset RTC reset L &

---------03:16----------
intruder and Inter vermin are pulled up

---------03:18----------
destroyed pro point destroyed via n

---------03:21----------
probe point so

---------03:44----------
yep

---------03:45----------
come Wednesday that boards gonna be made

---------03:48----------
great again by Paul s alright let's move

---------03:57----------
on to the next one but really what do

---------03:58----------
you have to do to your MacBook for that

---------04:00----------
to happen to it I really think that's a

---------04:03----------
troll I think that was said that

---------04:04----------
couldn't have been a real customer no

---------04:08----------
that's that's the that's acid it's just

---------04:10----------
pure acid fix my Kindle please what I

---------04:14----------
sent an email we don't fix Kindles
