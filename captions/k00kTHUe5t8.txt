---------00:00----------
so today we're gonna be working on a mac

---------00:02----------
book and this mac book appears to be

---------00:05----------
dead if I look at the desk and I zoom in

---------00:08----------
on my USB amp meter here you'll see that

---------00:11----------
it's drawing nineteen point three volts

---------00:13----------
I mean it's at nineteen point three

---------00:15----------
volts and at zero point zero three amps

---------00:17----------
and then back to zero so it's trying to

---------00:19----------
turn on but then it's failing to turn on

---------00:21----------
so we're gonna try and figure out why it

---------00:23----------
is that it's failing to turn on so first

---------00:25----------
thing that we have to do in order to

---------00:26----------
figure that out is we have to go over

---------00:28----------
our power rails so let's go over the

---------00:30----------
power rails on this much bar and the

---------00:33----------
first rail that we need to find is pp

---------00:35----------
bus g3 hod VP bus is present next rail

---------00:39----------
pp 3 v3 underscore g3 hot and we can

---------00:43----------
measure that over here alright next for

---------00:48----------
this thingy that I imagine is the SMC

---------00:53----------
and we get 3 point 4 volts next rail our

---------00:56----------
RTC rail this used to be called PPV RTC

---------01:00----------
underscore g3 hot but now it's called

---------01:03----------
something new pp 3 vo underscore g3 hot

---------01:06----------
and that rail is supposed to show up

---------01:08----------
right next to this chip over here called

---------01:09----------
banjo which is our p.m. I see the p.m. I

---------01:13----------
see is called banjo in honor of Bo

---------01:16----------
Burnham song about country music and P 3

---------01:20----------
v 3o underscore G 3 hot is now 3 volts

---------01:24----------
so let's continue down the list here and

---------01:26----------
figure out what rails are missing 5 volt

---------01:28----------
rail let's check PP 5 vs 5 and that's

---------01:32----------
gonna be on this side of Macbook PP 5 vs

---------01:38----------
4 is not present well let's figure out

---------01:41----------
what makes PP 5 es for this chip over

---------01:44----------
here is gonna be our 3 volt and 5 volt

---------01:47----------
power supply

---------01:47----------
it creates PP 5 es 4 VA u 65 v u 60 70

---------01:53----------
650 using qu 7600 to send pulses of pp

---------01:58----------
bus g3 hot through this coil which will

---------02:01----------
then be averaged out by the caps into a

---------02:02----------
nice 5 volts it's enabled by P 5 vs 4

---------02:06----------
underscore en underscore our CD let's

---------02:11----------
see where that is

---------02:12----------
it's gonna be present on any one of

---------02:18----------
these three pins so the enable for the

---------02:22----------
s4 will be here and the enable is not

---------02:28----------
there

---------02:28----------
there's no enable now let's see if we

---------02:32----------
have the enable for PP 3 V 3 S 5 on the

---------02:34----------
side

---------02:42----------
I feel very trolled right now how much

---------02:48----------
do you expect aphaia to fix in the USB

---------02:50----------
port in the MacBook Pro I don't know

---------02:53----------
depends on where you go ends on it

---------02:59----------
depends on what's causing your USB port

---------03:01----------
to not work if it's a board issue or is

---------03:04----------
it one of the USB ports that just plugs

---------03:05----------
in is it a board issue or is it the

---------03:07----------
actual port plugging and that's doing it

---------03:09----------
alright so PP 3 V 3 S 5 is there and

---------03:11----------
it's being told to turn on but our s 4

---------03:14----------
rails are missing and our S 4 rails are

---------03:17----------
missing because this board needs is

---------03:20----------
begging for Paul I think this board is

---------03:23----------
begging for Paul so let's see wait well

---------03:27----------
we're gonna find that out and just one

---------03:28----------
man of course I say it's p.m. sleep s5l

---------03:34----------
p.m. sleep as 5l is what turns on the s

---------03:38----------
for rails so p.m. sleep as 5l would be

---------03:42----------
over here and it's missing so p.m. sleep

---------03:47----------
as 5 l comes from where does PM sleep s

---------03:51----------
5l gonna come from it comes from the CPU

---------04:02----------
so p.m. sleeve s 5l which comes from the

---------04:06----------
CPU appears to be missing now to

---------04:11----------
introduce you to Paul has anybody met

---------04:16----------
Paul actually this is not the CPU you

---------04:18----------
1100 is the PCH and the PCH is going to

---------04:24----------
be this thing over here

---------04:32----------
let's look at that area under the

---------04:35----------
microscope and as you can see this area

---------04:44----------
looks beautiful it looks like it's never

---------04:47----------
been challenged at all no water no

---------04:50----------
corrosion no drop damage ah ha ha ha

---------04:57----------
what's this what's that

---------05:00----------
what are you I see liquid damage on this

---------05:03----------
MacBook it has revealed itself via the

---------05:07----------
quality of my am scope microscope don't

---------05:09----------
delay by today by clicking one of the

---------05:11----------
affiliate links in the video description

---------05:12----------
down below let's see what that is what

---------05:15----------
are you what are you where are you what

---------05:20----------
are you I found you I found you on this

---------05:26----------
little MacBook you think I have a hint

---------05:31----------
so you are you are from banjo let me

---------05:38----------
mute if we look on the screen this has

---------05:40----------
something to do with the power supply

---------05:42----------
for P P 1 vo sus is this here a

---------05:45----------
prerequisite to p.m. sleep s 5l and also

---------05:48----------
what's this capacitor that's supposed to

---------05:50----------
be next to it that appears to be ripped

---------05:51----------
off the board

---------05:52----------
and /or no stuff ca 0 0 3 over here

---------05:56----------
appears to be a capacitor that's

---------05:59----------
supposed to be there because it doesn't

---------06:00----------
say no stuff but if we look on the

---------06:03----------
motherboard you can see that this looks

---------06:06----------
like it's ripped off as is this trace

---------06:09----------
over here ripped off so we're gonna

---------06:11----------
switch over to the microscope and zoom

---------06:12----------
in very nicely on this this is a machine

---------06:17----------
that's missing PM sleep s 5l and today

---------06:20----------
we're going to learn if P P 1 vo sus is

---------06:24----------
a prerequisite to PP p.m. sleep as 5l

---------06:28----------
this resistor looks like it would come

---------06:30----------
off if I tapped it the wrong way so

---------06:32----------
we're gonna be very careful here with

---------06:34----------
little MacBook and if this is all it is

---------06:39----------
this may be an easy touch bar that we

---------06:41----------
don't have to give to Paul ran

---------06:44----------
cherry picking what's aya grab the touch

---------06:46----------
bar I tried to grab a hard one

---------06:48----------
so we're gonna remove this

---------07:08----------
what's the donor board look like I

---------07:10----------
haven't I haven't gotten a donor board

---------07:11----------
yet that requires getting up so I've

---------07:14----------
been procrastinating doing that I also

---------07:16----------
got to leave in about 10 minutes to go

---------07:19----------
see my doctor I may have grabbed a touch

---------07:21----------
bar board that only needs one resistor

---------07:24----------
so check it out Paul

---------07:26----------
so this resistor was missing from the

---------07:28----------
board for pp1 I mean it was knocked off

---------07:31----------
no this resistor was corroded and the

---------07:32----------
capacitor that it's in series with was

---------07:34----------
missing for the 1vo sauce power supply

---------07:37----------
and p.m. sleep s5l was missing so I'm

---------07:40----------
thinking that this power rail over here

---------07:41----------
may be a prerequisite to having p.m.

---------07:44----------
sleep s5l on touch bars that's my guess

---------07:47----------
I'm hoping that that is it so if I

---------07:49----------
replace this stuff and run the jumpers

---------07:50----------
and it works

---------07:50----------
that means when p.m. sleep best 5l is

---------07:52----------
missing instead of just tossing it into

---------07:54----------
the garbage pile of four for Paul to

---------07:57----------
zelma we we should check this rail and

---------08:02----------
if this doesn't work then it goes in the

---------08:05----------
desk of you know this is probably gonna

---------08:12----------
work I don't know what knocked us off

---------08:15----------
though this it didn't look like this had

---------08:17----------
ever been open before and that barely

---------08:19----------
looked like liquid damage but I mean you

---------08:20----------
know it was because it's green but this

---------08:23----------
also looks like it was physically

---------08:25----------
knocked off the board which is where my

---------08:26----------
skepticism comes into play

---------08:40----------
I wanna be very careful here to not

---------08:42----------
destroy whatever's left this little

---------08:43----------
copper Pro point so not scraping too

---------08:46----------
hard I'm just running a solder ball over

---------08:47----------
it

---------08:48----------
solder blob we're just gonna add a tiny

---------08:52----------
bit of flux to that just to make sure it

---------08:53----------
continues to we did get new flux in the

---------08:56----------
stock by the way so I can go back to

---------08:59----------
using a mil appall of flux

---------09:08----------
okay I'm gonna try and rebuild it to

---------09:10----------
rehabilitate that pro point the most

---------09:15----------
gentle of scraping

---------09:24----------
we're working on making this Chooch

---------09:27----------
speaking of Kuching did we send the

---------09:29----------
laptops to a VE for a period we need to

---------09:33----------
send those laptops to a VE before those

---------09:35----------
customers get angry that the repair is

---------09:37----------
not being completed in a timely fashion

---------09:39----------
all right so I confirmed on the donor

---------09:41----------
board that those pieces are indeed

---------09:42----------
supposed to be here on the touch bar

---------09:50----------
much bar

---------10:16----------
America

---------10:27----------
and I don't want to take any chances

---------10:29----------
with this so I'm gonna make sure that

---------10:34----------
this is wired up all nicely since these

---------10:42----------
traces all look like crap

---------10:47----------
america [ __ ] yeah

---------10:56----------
so you just rebuild the reef ball the PM

---------10:59----------
I see that we don't need I'm sure we

---------11:04----------
will all right next one we're gonna do

---------11:27----------
what are you ultrasonic stop ruining my

---------11:31----------
video and that you know turn it off

---------11:36----------
hiss it's no point to ultrasonic a chip

---------11:41----------
okay next I'm taking no chances with

---------11:47----------
these crappy looking traces

---------12:14----------
all right so at this point I believe our

---------12:17----------
touch bar much bar should be fixed so

---------12:24----------
let's see if we get Chu Qing fan spin V

---------12:28----------
core amperage so it appears that it's

---------12:35----------
taking one point zero six amps which

---------12:38----------
means it's Chu Ching look at that oh

---------12:42----------
[ __ ] I moved it around so it stopped

---------12:45----------
got that here we go yeah one point four

---------12:48----------
amps one amp point nine one amp it's

---------12:54----------
turning on and Xu Qing

---------12:56----------
let's see if we get an image cuz if we

---------12:57----------
get an image that'll be even better I

---------12:59----------
don't expect to get an image on this I

---------13:01----------
mean that that's asking way too much the

---------13:03----------
touch bar actually have a picture I

---------13:06----------
don't want to get greedy now Macbook

---------13:10----------
gonna plug the screen in that's all I

---------13:12----------
care about let's see if we get a screen

---------13:14----------
and an Apple logo on this little MacBook

---------13:18----------
MacBook now stay in don't you tip over

---------13:23----------
you mofo when I plug here we go one

---------13:26----------
point 45 amps 1.2 1.1 0.9 1.2 1 ok it

---------13:33----------
seems like now it's staying on hey hey

---------13:37----------
macbook ok so I probably had the Wi-Fi

---------13:40----------
wire touching something that it wasn't

---------13:42----------
supposed to touch so it looks like this

---------13:44----------
is working it is booting it's true which

---------13:49----------
means that by a completely random choice

---------13:52----------
I managed that it's used the first touch

---------13:54----------
bar of the day and all it needed was a

---------13:57----------
resistor and a capacitor that were easy

---------13:59----------
to find this is entirely random random

---------14:14----------
ran

---------14:17----------
now so the important thing to go over

---------14:19----------
here is what we learned from this and

---------14:21----------
what I've said is even going back three

---------14:23----------
years is that you when you have water

---------14:26----------
damage the great thing about water

---------14:27----------
damage is that it illuminates where the

---------14:29----------
issue is so then what you can do is you

---------14:31----------
can match the symptoms that you had to

---------14:33----------
the issue that you can match the

---------14:35----------
symptoms you had to the physical

---------14:38----------
abnormalities on the board so what we

---------14:40----------
did is we went through the list of power

---------14:41----------
rails let me just find this over here

---------14:44----------
the list of power rails is at the end

---------14:46----------
here we go so we went through the list

---------14:47----------
of rails and we noticed that the rail

---------14:51----------
that we had missing was up PP 5 vs 4 and

---------14:55----------
this would be so we would typically

---------14:58----------
start with the S 5 rails go to the SOS

---------15:00----------
for rails and so on and so forth and

---------15:02----------
p.m. sleep s 5 l was missing that's one

---------15:05----------
of the things that's required to turn on

---------15:07----------
PP 5 es 4 and that was it used 7650 so

---------15:10----------
you 7650 we were missing p 5 vs for en

---------15:15----------
this would enable the PP 5 es for rail

---------15:18----------
and when we followed this back this

---------15:21----------
comes from p.m. sleep s 5l over here and

---------15:26----------
PM sleep s 5l is going to come from the

---------15:31----------
PCH over here which on the dual-core

---------15:35----------
models is integrated into the CPU on the

---------15:38----------
quad-core models here is on the platform

---------15:40----------
controller hub but it's kind of like a

---------15:41----------
north bridge in the South Bridge and a

---------15:43----------
graphics communicated between in telling

---------15:45----------
us and the MOX all at once Intel CPU and

---------15:47----------
the MUX all at once and some of the

---------15:49----------
older models so we were missing p.m.

---------15:52----------
sleep s 5l then we noticed that there

---------15:54----------
was corrosion on these two resistors

---------15:58----------
over here in capacitors this resistor

---------16:00----------
and capacitor are eight zero zero one

---------16:02----------
and C eight zero zero three these two

---------16:06----------
are responsible for allowing you 7800 to

---------16:10----------
create P P 1 vo sus so what I know now

---------16:13----------
is that if I'm missing PM sleep s 5l I

---------16:15----------
should check and ensure that I have P P

---------16:18----------
1 vo sus because P P 1 vo sus is

---------16:21----------
required and as you can see here the PCH

---------16:24----------
on these newer Mac books all operates on

---------16:26----------
P P 1 vo sus so this over here is the

---------16:28----------
PCH and as you can see all of the ins

---------16:31----------
balls on the PCH RP P 1 vo so P P 1 vo s

---------16:35----------
s is very important on the newer

---------16:36----------
MacBooks and touch bars so if you're

---------16:38----------
missing p.m. sleep as 5l rather than

---------16:40----------
doing what we used to do which is

---------16:43----------
frisbee 'm now we know for the next

---------16:45----------
machines when you're missing p.m. sleep

---------16:47----------
s 5l check P P 1 vo sus because it is

---------16:49----------
important that's it for today and as

---------16:51----------
always I hope you learned something and

---------16:53----------
as always when you're going to the Q

---------16:56----------
make sure that you pick all your boards

---------16:58----------
at random
