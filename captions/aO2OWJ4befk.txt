---------00:00----------
and so a lot of people talk about

---------00:00----------
getting in a dealing with wholesale

---------00:02----------
clients because consumers are a pain in

---------00:03----------
the ass because they don't want to deal

---------00:05----------
with consumers they don't want do

---------00:06----------
customer service they don't want to deal

---------00:07----------
with having to explain things and I want

---------00:10----------
to talk a little bit about why that's

---------00:11----------
kind of a bunch of crap the first things

---------00:13----------
first is that in the consumer market you

---------00:15----------
can charge more money and the second

---------00:17----------
thing is that it doesn't matter if you

---------00:18----------
are dealing with a consumer a small

---------00:20----------
business a small store or a refurbishing

---------00:24----------
center that has thousands of thousands

---------00:25----------
of machines you're always going to be

---------00:27----------
dealing with idiots and I want to talk a

---------00:28----------
little bit about why this is important

---------00:30----------
here when we go over the snow backlight

---------00:31----------
problems this is a no backlight problem

---------00:33----------
that was sent in by another place and

---------00:35----------
one of the problems that I've been

---------00:37----------
having is that they actually say they

---------00:38----------
sometimes they plug in the that

---------00:39----------
that cause the board to die and then

---------00:42----------
they send it back asking for warranty

---------00:45----------
and I'm courteous so I'll do it but that

---------00:48----------
really does need to end so what I

---------00:50----------
started doing is because I realized that

---------00:52----------
you are going to say you it doesn't

---------00:54----------
matter how burned or up or

---------00:55----------
destroyed something is that you're going

---------00:56----------
to plug it right back into that board

---------00:58----------
that what i need to do because you can't

---------01:00----------
see that with your eyes and realize that

---------01:02----------
i shouldn't do that is I take my xlite

---------01:04----------
175 m cutters and I just chopped the

---------01:06----------
cable right off so we're going to go

---------01:08----------
over the no backlight issue on this

---------01:09----------
board over here and I'm going to let you

---------01:11----------
see under the microscope what's going on

---------01:13----------
so if you look at the LCD connector it

---------01:15----------
doesn't all it doesn't look that great

---------01:17----------
it works it's it's gonna do it it's

---------01:19----------
gonna do the job but it just doesn't

---------01:20----------
look really nice but this is this is

---------01:23----------
honestly this is fine this is really not

---------01:27----------
worth the time to replace and the other

---------01:29----------
issue is that the fuse itself is blown

---------01:31----------
now I don't measure a short to ground so

---------01:34----------
I feel like I can just replace that fuse

---------01:35----------
and I'm good so we're going to go ahead

---------01:38----------
and do that now i'm going to replace the

---------01:40----------
fuse and after it at the end i'm going

---------01:42----------
to show you what we're talking about

---------01:43----------
here with the silk with the whole

---------01:44----------
silliness take my hat Air Station

---------02:16----------
remove all that nasty old let free

---------03:52----------
let's try

---------04:08----------
surface tension puts it into place tap

---------04:11----------
it down and we're all good so that's my

---------04:15----------
new fuse now at this point if i plug in

---------04:18----------
a new screen I should be just fine do

---------04:27----------
you have an air assembly out that I can

---------04:28----------
test with thanks I should plug there's

---------04:40----------
in

---------05:31----------
who is that as you can see I fixed the

---------05:36----------
board and it clearly works we have an

---------05:37----------
apple on the screen now here's where the

---------05:39----------
conflict comes in a play here's where

---------05:42----------
that whole thing of again like dealing

---------05:46----------
with repair shops being easier becomes a

---------05:48----------
bunch of a BS so what they said is this

---------05:51----------
time do not cut the cable do not cut the

---------05:54----------
cable they said because I don't want you

---------05:56----------
cutting the cable I want to reuse that

---------05:58----------
cable so let's show you what that looks

---------06:01----------
like ok we're ready get ready for this

---------06:04----------
LCD cable what the is wrong with

---------06:09----------
you people what what makes you think

---------06:11----------
that you could plug this back into

---------06:13----------
a motherboard look at this what makes

---------06:18----------
you think that I'm not going to cut that

---------06:20----------
cable and I'm gonna send it back to you

---------06:21----------
like that so here's what I'm going to do

---------06:22----------
I'm going to send this back to you

---------06:24----------
exactly as is and whether if you want to

---------06:28----------
replace this cable that's great if you

---------06:29----------
want to plug this cable back into that

---------06:30----------
motherboard that's also great but if you

---------06:32----------
ever send this back to me again I don't

---------06:34----------
care for what reason you could be

---------06:36----------
doesn't charge the battery it could be

---------06:38----------
no cpu vcore it could be running slow I

---------06:40----------
don't care I'm not warranting stuff like

---------06:42----------
this and that's what you asked me to do

---------06:44----------
because I know exactly what you're gonna

---------06:45----------
do take this little cable plug it back

---------06:48----------
on the board a week from now we're gonna

---------06:50----------
get a phone call saying and I'm not

---------06:56----------
going to care so don't be an idiot don't

---------06:59----------
plug that looks like this back into

---------07:01----------
the board it will break it it is bad

---------07:04----------
that is what causes your short to ground

---------07:05----------
that is why this is here why do you want

---------07:08----------
to cause yourself extra hassle and make

---------07:09----------
your customers lives miserable and make

---------07:11----------
your lives miserable make your staffs

---------07:13----------
lives miserable have an answer these

---------07:14----------
phone calls from angry customers because

---------07:15----------
you don't want to replace a cable

---------07:17----------
because you don't know that you're not

---------07:17----------
supposed to plug burn stuff back into a

---------07:19----------
motherboard
