---------00:00----------
hello one and all a quick shilling

---------00:02----------
announcement before I get started I

---------00:03----------
managed to steal some quicks away from

---------00:06----------
quick their production has been really

---------00:08----------
slow recently and it is driven up the

---------00:09----------
price but finally not only are quicks

---------00:12----------
back in stock but they are back in stock

---------00:14----------
for the newly negotiated low price of

---------00:17----------
260 9.99

---------00:18----------
so the first thing we have in a pile is

---------00:21----------
a border pair that Paul s missed out on

---------00:22----------
which is a no backlight hey itright why

---------00:33----------
does this macbook have no backlight

---------00:34----------
looks pretty clean to me even the LCD

---------00:38----------
connector looks pretty clean perhaps it

---------00:41----------
just needs to be plugged in and

---------00:42----------
unplugged let's see what happens when I

---------00:45----------
turn it on turn on little MacBook

---------00:48----------
alright so we're gonna check a couple of

---------00:50----------
things so if you look over at the LCD

---------00:53----------
connector J 8300 backlight should be on

---------00:55----------
pin 1 0 volts now LCD power is going to

---------01:04----------
come in on pins 28 29 and 30 over here

---------01:10----------
PP v vr 3v whatever the hell else edy so

---------01:15----------
that's 5 volts of the LCD so let's see

---------01:16----------
if the LCD is even turning on it is

---------01:21----------
turning on we're getting 5 volts now

---------01:23----------
let's see if we have a short 2 grams on

---------01:25----------
backlight output so I'm going to turn

---------01:26----------
this off and check back on pin 1 where

---------01:29----------
backlight supposed to be wouldn't be

---------01:32----------
nice if this was an easy no backlight

---------01:34----------
and there's no short 2 grounds on

---------01:37----------
backlight output hmmm this back this no

---------01:40----------
backlight may require that I actually do

---------01:42----------
a little bit of work so there's going to

---------01:44----------
be a data line with the LED driver in

---------01:47----------
the screen that's I to see Vic lit

---------01:50----------
backlight right over here on pins 3 & 4

---------01:55----------
of the connector see that eye to see

---------01:57----------
backlight so let's check out the voltage

---------02:00----------
on that data line hey no way in hell

---------02:08----------
I've just turned the Macbook back on and

---------02:11----------
we have voltage on the data line so the

---------02:14----------
data line doesn't seem like it's being

---------02:16----------
weighed the data line may be being

---------02:18----------
pulled down on pin for we're getting

---------02:20----------
point seven volts hey what's up with

---------02:24----------
that why is the data line being pulled

---------02:28----------
down 2.5 volts I'm expecting 5 volts in

---------02:31----------
that data line and I'll show you why

---------02:32----------
right here so the pull-up resistor for

---------02:36----------
that data line is a 5 volt resistor and

---------02:40----------
if you check out my videos on what a

---------02:42----------
pull-up resistor is and how a data line

---------02:44----------
works you'll see that the voltage that

---------02:47----------
you should get at the top of the data

---------02:48----------
line is the voltage of the power rail

---------02:53----------
being used to pull it up so that should

---------02:55----------
be going between 5 volts and 0 and back

---------02:57----------
and forth but it should not be stuck at

---------02:59----------
something as low as point 4 point 5

---------03:01----------
volts something's wrong there this is

---------03:03----------
something on the board or is it the

---------03:04----------
screen itself so I'm gonna unplug the

---------03:06----------
screen yes I did it while the machine is

---------03:08----------
still on because I'm a and this machine

---------03:10----------
does not has current sensing on

---------03:12----------
backlight output so I can't blow the

---------03:14----------
backlight fuse and as you can see the

---------03:17----------
voltage is still sitting at 1.2 volts

---------03:19----------
even without a screen plugged in so this

---------03:20----------
doesn't really seem to be a screen issue

---------03:22----------
it seems to be a board issue alright so

---------03:25----------
this is gonna be an interesting note

---------03:26----------
back light one so let's take the board

---------03:27----------
out and see what it looks like on the

---------03:29----------
other side take out the board take a

---------03:32----------
look at the machine we're gonna have the

---------03:33----------
machine on a nice clean orange mat so we

---------03:36----------
don't scratch anything ok got myself a

---------03:38----------
t5 screwdriver let's take the board out

---------03:43----------
need to put all our screws on a magnet

---------03:46----------
now you may notice I got a new zoom lens

---------03:49----------
probably a little too good for my own

---------03:51----------
good and so you could tell just a minute

---------03:53----------
ago so you can see what I'm doing here

---------03:56----------
better this is not digital zoom I'm

---------03:57----------
actually used I could get a picture of

---------04:00----------
that but I guess yeah can I point the

---------04:01----------
camera that's my sony a 5100 but i'm

---------04:05----------
using the lens from the camcorder on it

---------04:06----------
this here is a zoom lens so that is not

---------04:09----------
digital zoom that is pure unadulterated

---------04:13----------
analog zoom

---------04:22----------
you

---------04:41----------
this is a disgusting macbook let's take

---------04:44----------
a look at this disgusting macbook let's

---------04:46----------
see what do we have here on this macbook

---------04:48----------
Oh God

---------04:51----------
oh dear Jesus what did you do to your

---------04:59----------
macbook customer what did you do to this

---------05:04----------
MacBook this MacBook got owned

---------05:09----------
sorry little MacBook I'm sorry little

---------05:13----------
MacBook all right so let's figure out

---------05:15----------
which which section of this is relevant

---------05:18----------
to our damage claim so we have that I is

---------05:23----------
it I to see your I squared C it's I to

---------05:27----------
see right yeah I think it's I to see so

---------05:32----------
this we have this I to who see line and

---------05:35----------
there is actually a capacitor to ground

---------05:38----------
on it check this out

---------05:40----------
see this it's hard to see over here but

---------05:43----------
I on our line I to see B bikal it s da

---------05:49----------
there is a capacitor up here and those

---------05:51----------
that capacitor goes to ground and it's

---------05:53----------
right over here

---------05:53----------
so see we have the two capacitors that

---------05:55----------
are going up and down where what the one

---------05:56----------
on the left is a teeny tiny bit higher

---------05:58----------
than the one on the right so there's

---------06:00----------
these two capacitors here and then right

---------06:03----------
up over here that's the capacitor to

---------06:05----------
ground so that could be shorting the

---------06:07----------
rail to ground so let's take a look on

---------06:08----------
the actual board itself and see if we

---------06:10----------
could find that so we got the two

---------06:11----------
capacitors but one going up and down

---------06:13----------
another going up and down slightly

---------06:14----------
higher and then up here is the capacitor

---------06:17----------
on that rail

---------06:26----------
begone all right so we've removed the

---------06:29----------
capacitor using a highly advanced

---------06:32----------
technology now let's see if there's a

---------06:38----------
backlight this is where I'm probably

---------06:40----------
gonna get in trouble for live-streaming

---------06:41----------
I've been getting more and more calls

---------06:43----------
from people that are offended at stuff

---------06:44----------
like this yeah yeah yeah I mean you got

---------06:54----------
to watch these videos before you send

---------06:56----------
this stuff in so you kind of I don't

---------06:59----------
know I've been honestly kind of mean and

---------07:01----------
responding to a lot of those like I've

---------07:02----------
said you know it's not like I hit how I

---------07:04----------
fix things it's not like you can't see

---------07:06----------
it in every damn video you knew what

---------07:08----------
you're signing up for more phones yeah

---------07:10----------
it's like you see what you signing up

---------07:12----------
for it's not like I hide it boo still no

---------07:16----------
backlight we still have nothing so let

---------07:20----------
me just check and see if I've gotten any

---------07:21----------
change yeah it's still the same problem

---------07:31----------
its pull-up resistor is our seven seven

---------07:34----------
five three are seven seven five three

---------07:40----------
measures one point six kilohms schematic

---------07:44----------
says 2.4 close enough for me

---------07:47----------
and this 18 kilo ohms to ground hmm I

---------07:55----------
think we're being messed with here so

---------08:01----------
before I get to ya we're being messed

---------08:05----------
with here so something is going wrong

---------08:07----------
when it's turned on so either it

---------08:08----------
actually is the screen after all or it's

---------08:10----------
the LED driver itself increasing the

---------08:12----------
resistance only when it's turned on

---------08:14----------
those are the only possible thing

---------08:16----------
because the LED drivers the other thing

---------08:17----------
that is on that line so first things

---------08:20----------
first let's just clean up this area this

---------08:23----------
is unacceptable

---------08:24----------
let's put some a little bit of flux on

---------08:26----------
there not too much just enough to get

---------08:28----------
the job done just the small bit of flux

---------08:38----------
you

---------09:22----------
beautiful jumpers all flow in a place

---------09:24----------
and everything looks nice

---------09:33----------
c'mon Pat come solder ball

---------09:43----------
so when I was looking around there I

---------09:44----------
noticed that some of these little holes

---------09:46----------
over here where a signal will go to the

---------09:48----------
other side of the board seem to be worn

---------09:50----------
out and I'm thinking to myself what if

---------09:52----------
those holes are worn out for the SDA

---------09:56----------
signal then it could very well be the

---------09:59----------
case and take a look at what this looks

---------10:02----------
like over here so I to see backlight SDA

---------10:07----------
look see this line it goes from the the

---------10:13----------
LED driver so this is where it's gonna

---------10:15----------
talk to the LED driver this is the

---------10:18----------
pull-up resistor that's going to pull it

---------10:20----------
up to five volts it goes to this

---------10:22----------
capacitor then from there it goes to the

---------10:24----------
other side of the board and that's where

---------10:26----------
it makes it to my LCD connector see

---------10:28----------
right over here this is the connection

---------10:30----------
now look at that connection on the board

---------10:32----------
this is even after ever place components

---------10:34----------
and clean things this is not making its

---------10:37----------
way to the other side of the board at

---------10:38----------
all look at this totally burned out

---------10:49----------
this is broken see this you're broken

---------10:54----------
you're not making your way to where

---------10:56----------
you're supposed to go all right so we're

---------10:59----------
gonna reattach all of this watch wait

---------11:02----------
and see and then I guarantee we're gonna

---------11:04----------
have backlight so we're gonna reattach

---------11:06----------
this entire line from the capacitor to

---------11:10----------
the pull-up resistor okay so we're gonna

---------11:14----------
solder a wire throughout that entire

---------11:17----------
point they're gonna connect it from one

---------11:19----------
to the other to the other and then we'll

---------11:21----------
have backlight again this is definitely

---------11:23----------
an interesting one gotta send this video

---------11:25----------
to somebody next time they tell me but

---------11:27----------
can't you do why can't you just replace

---------11:28----------
the backlight fuse yeah so we're gonna

---------11:30----------
make a little round-the-world jumper

---------11:32----------
wire

---------12:29----------
our final destination ten-four

---------12:41----------
just recited the pins that I was tapping

---------12:43----------
with my multimeter probe

---------12:44----------
make them all nice is that why are

---------12:49----------
isolated of course it is it's enameled

---------12:51----------
it's resistant to any type of electrical

---------12:53----------
interference it's designed specially for

---------12:56----------
data lines I mean it's it's special wire

---------12:59----------
that's designed specially for data lines

---------13:01----------
like it just soldered directly to the

---------13:03----------
via here as well the anchor someone says

---------13:07----------
I say Lois is gonna have egg on his face

---------13:09----------
in a few moments no why just because I

---------13:11----------
rounded it around a bunch of high

---------13:12----------
voltage Thunderball power lines and even

---------13:14----------
that it'll be fine why do you have no

---------13:17----------
faith in me nobody watching has any

---------13:20----------
faith wait see you see this is gonna be

---------13:22----------
anchored this is gonna be this is gonna

---------13:24----------
be beautiful this is gonna be awesome

---------13:26----------
it's gonna look beautiful it's gonna be

---------13:28----------
beautiful it's gonna have a nice light

---------13:29----------
it's gonna have thunderbolt it's gonna

---------13:30----------
have a USB by God so long as they don't

---------13:33----------
bring this into Apple under Apple care

---------13:34----------
the age the customers should be fine if

---------13:37----------
they do bring this to Apple under Apple

---------13:38----------
care then god help them

---------14:13----------
really

---------14:16----------
so the screen comes on still no effing

---------14:20----------
backlight wait a second now that now pin

---------14:27----------
3 is point 4 volts whoa what the hell is

---------14:31----------
up with that let me clear

---------14:32----------
so before pin 4 was the one that was low

---------14:34----------
now pin 3 is the one that's low - you

---------14:38----------
got to be kidding what is this this

---------14:41----------
musical broken v's seriously pin 4 was

---------14:44----------
the one I know if I were wind this video

---------14:46----------
and I look back it's pin 4 that was had

---------14:48----------
the mess up and now pin 3 is also giving

---------14:51----------
me nothing this is a troll this is a

---------14:53----------
huge troll let's try this again I don't

---------14:58----------
I refuse to believe and believe that

---------14:59----------
result okay clean microscope clean the

---------15:04----------
microscope got the multimeter on the

---------15:06----------
screen pin 3 is what you piece of Shh

---------15:14----------
no way no way so I fixed pin 4 and now

---------15:17----------
pin 3 doesn't want to work really all

---------15:20----------
right no no no no we're gonna do this

---------15:22----------
okay where's pin 3 on here so pin 3 of

---------15:27----------
the LCD connector is gonna be the SCL

---------15:29----------
line maybe that was a broken via there

---------15:31----------
and that got revealed while I was

---------15:34----------
working on the area okay let's see where

---------15:39----------
is that little capacitor

---------15:50----------
all right

---------15:52----------
so that's gonna be this little capacitor

---------15:58----------
over here and that goes to this via

---------16:02----------
which is also burned see this goes to

---------16:08----------
here and this is burned

---------16:26----------
all right I think I could fill that hole

---------16:28----------
with solder said it makes it to the

---------16:32----------
other side I'm pretty good at filling

---------16:37----------
holes with burning metal fluid that is

---------16:41----------
all right so that may actually work like

---------16:44----------
that let's see if it works like that I'm

---------16:47----------
still gonna probably run a wire because

---------16:49----------
I don't trust that at all well let's see

---------16:51----------
you never know maybe that'll do it

---------16:52----------
and we still get 0 volts on backlight

---------16:53----------
alright so I'm guessing that that

---------16:55----------
filling that vias hole is not enough we

---------16:58----------
need to do more than fill the hole

---------16:59----------
filling the hole isn't enough to fulfill

---------17:00----------
this relationship this board wants

---------17:02----------
romance as well so I'm guessing that I'm

---------17:04----------
still gonna be getting one point eight

---------17:05----------
or so volts at pin three and if not then

---------17:07----------
this is a board for Paul he wanted he

---------17:10----------
was the one who wanted this no backlight

---------17:11----------
in the first place yeah even with the

---------17:15----------
vias hole fill that's no good this one's

---------17:17----------
five one that one's point four so we

---------17:20----------
need to run a wire for that one as well

---------17:24----------
all right let's do it

---------18:33----------
backlight forty-nine volts weight 49

---------18:39----------
volts means that the screen is not good

---------18:42----------
that means that the voltage isn't making

---------18:44----------
its way to the screen so we're getting

---------18:46----------
49 volts on backlight now but that's

---------18:47----------
actually too high yeah so let me talk

---------18:53----------
about why this is the case so let's say

---------18:55----------
you have a circuit that's designed to

---------18:56----------
make 36 volts with a load if you then

---------18:59----------
put no load it's gonna create more

---------19:01----------
voltage so for example let's say that

---------19:03----------
I'm pushing on the desk right I'm not

---------19:06----------
falling over because there's resistance

---------19:08----------
the desk weighs something however if I

---------19:10----------
were to push that like really just dig

---------19:13----------
in and push as hard as I can and there

---------19:14----------
was no resistance I'd fall down because

---------19:16----------
there's no resistance so same thing is

---------19:19----------
true here this circuit is trying to make

---------19:20----------
let's say 39 volts for the backlight the

---------19:22----------
circuit for the screen but since there's

---------19:24----------
no screen as a resistive load we have 49

---------19:27----------
volts if you have 49 volts in a

---------19:28----------
backlight in a ret and it means it's not

---------19:30----------
making its way to the LCD connector the

---------19:32----------
LCD cable is bad or the screen is bad so

---------19:34----------
let's see which is the case with this

---------19:37----------
guy is very disgusting looking MacBook

---------19:39----------
so I'm gonna unplug it and we're going

---------19:42----------
to plug it in again and measure the

---------19:45----------
voltage on the LCD connector itself and

---------19:48----------
if we don't get it on the LCD connector

---------19:50----------
then this will be a case for Paul is the

---------19:52----------
voltage making its way to the LCD

---------19:54----------
connector what do we get here

---------19:55----------
so we get 49 volts here which means it's

---------19:58----------
an issue with the screen cable or the

---------20:00----------
screen so I'm gonna test now but at

---------20:02----------
least the circuit is being told to

---------20:03----------
create a backlight voltage so now I have

---------20:06----------
to find the screen that is the little

---------20:07----------
elephant or sheep on it alright so here

---------20:09----------
we have a messed up screen assembly that

---------20:10----------
I just use for testing

---------20:12----------
it's too bad to give to a customer but

---------20:15----------
we can at least use it just to tell if a

---------20:17----------
machine works properly turn on the power

---------20:20----------
supply and backlight output is

---------20:30----------
right one Oh 30 eight here we go they

---------20:33----------
just had a post thirty-eight volts so 38

---------20:36----------
volts is a good value

---------20:37----------
38 volts means that it is producing a

---------20:40----------
backlight it's not too low to producer

---------20:42----------
backlight but it's not also so high that

---------20:43----------
it tells me that there's no resistive

---------20:45----------
load from the backlight circuit not

---------20:48----------
being fully attached to the screen

---------20:49----------
shortly you're gonna see a question mark

---------20:51----------
logo I'm excited

---------20:53----------
are you gonna see that question mark

---------20:55----------
logo I'll explain what was wrong with

---------20:57----------
the board and then we'll move on and

---------20:59----------
I'll get myself some food since I'm now

---------21:01----------
hungry because I've spent an hour and

---------21:03----------
six minutes on a no backlight repair

---------21:05----------
that is shameful so as you can see we

---------21:08----------
are getting a flashing question mark

---------21:09----------
folder since I've got the lighting right

---------21:11----------
above me you can't really see it too

---------21:12----------
well from this angle but it is indeed a

---------21:16----------
light and if you don't believe me from

---------21:17----------
the picture well 38 volts so let's go

---------21:21----------
over why this is happening the reason

---------21:23----------
that we were getting no backlight in the

---------21:25----------
beginning was that the screen was not

---------21:26----------
communicating with the backlight driver

---------21:28----------
something that a lot of people don't

---------21:29----------
realize is that on the newer retinas

---------21:31----------
that the screen needs to communicate

---------21:33----------
with the backlight driver or else it's

---------21:34----------
not going to produce backlight voltage

---------21:36----------
and if you look on the schematic this is

---------21:38----------
the LED driver you 7,700 lp8 5 4 8 B 1

---------21:43----------
sq and this is the LCD and keyboard

---------21:46----------
backlight driver this has a data line C

---------21:49----------
SCL and SDA this is an I squared C data

---------21:53----------
line and it is pulled up by our seven

---------21:57----------
seven five two and our eight seven seven

---------21:58----------
five three these pull-up resistors bring

---------22:01----------
the data line up to 5 volts anytime that

---------22:03----------
the screen wants to talk to the computer

---------22:05----------
or the computer wants to talk to the

---------22:07----------
screen it's going to pull it down so

---------22:09----------
instead of it being 5 volts and be 5

---------22:11----------
volts 0 5 volts 0 5 volts 0 and it's

---------22:14----------
going to make every time it shorts that

---------22:15----------
data line of ground it's making a

---------22:17----------
waveform a line a communication whatever

---------22:20----------
you want to call it that's how they talk

---------22:21----------
to one another that's their language so

---------22:23----------
this was broken at the point at which it

---------22:27----------
attaches to the screen so i2c backlight

---------22:30----------
SCL and ICC backlight SDA it's gonna go

---------22:33----------
up here to a capacitor that capacitor is

---------22:37----------
that is going to go to ground to get rid

---------22:40----------
of any ripple and junk on the line

---------22:41----------
anything that's not supposed to be there

---------22:44----------
and then it's going to go to the LCD but

---------22:49----------
this little pro point over here and this

---------22:51----------
little one over here

---------22:52----------
we're corroded so it wasn't making its

---------22:54----------
way to the LCD but now it is and we ran

---------22:59----------
a wire however it's the design of a

---------23:01----------
backlight because either the screen of

---------23:03----------
the screen cable are broken we could

---------23:05----------
tell that because we were getting a

---------23:06----------
voltage that's too high we're getting 48

---------23:08----------
49 volts when it should be 39 volts 49

---------23:11----------
volts means that it was not seeing the

---------23:15----------
resistive load of the screen which tells

---------23:16----------
me inside of the screen of the screen

---------23:18----------
cable at that point that's also bad we

---------23:20----------
connect a new screen you get a backlight

---------23:22----------
and it works so that's it for today and

---------23:24----------
as always I hope you learned something

---------23:34----------
you
