---------00:00----------
so we have a Macbook this is an eight to

---------00:02----------
zero zero zero 165 let's get us it

---------00:06----------
schematic and board view into the view

---------00:09----------
scroll over to my list of power rails

---------00:20----------
now we have a green light in the charger

---------00:24----------
which means our PP three before two is

---------00:27----------
there and as we can see here I check

---------00:32----------
where I would expect my Pepa three

---------00:34----------
before to to be I get a nice kick of

---------00:37----------
three point 4 volts next is our pepper

---------00:40----------
bus g3 hot pepper bus is supposed to be

---------00:43----------
eight point six volts we can check it

---------00:46----------
here on this fuse f71 forty this is the

---------00:51----------
circuit that creates pepper bus g3 hot

---------00:54----------
from the adapter it's gonna take the

---------00:56----------
eighteen point whatever volts and turn

---------00:58----------
it into eight point six volts for the

---------01:00----------
system so on one side of the fuse on pin

---------01:03----------
one I get eight point six and on the

---------01:10----------
other side of the fuse and get zero next

---------01:14----------
hmm now that means the fuse is likely

---------01:18----------
blown which it is 12.5 mellow and it's

---------01:23----------
blown likely because in the side that

---------01:25----------
has no power there is a short to ground

---------01:28----------
which there is two point two ohms so

---------01:31----------
let's go searching for that short to

---------01:32----------
ground and see if we can find it do we

---------01:40----------
really need a thermal camera hmm ouch

---------01:48----------
I'm gonna take a guess that this is the

---------01:51----------
cause of our problem let me take the SSD

---------01:56----------
out so that were removing that capacitor

---------01:58----------
I don't destroy the solid-state drive

---------02:04----------
see a lot of the times you can just tell

---------02:07----------
by visual inspection what's going on

---------02:09----------
before you waste time injecting voltage

---------02:11----------
before you waste time dragging the

---------02:12----------
thermal

---------02:13----------
moreover and kind of get an idea what's

---------02:15----------
going on just put a metal plate over it

---------02:21----------
says Jan must have run over an oily

---------02:25----------
plate to get a crack like that yep that

---------02:27----------
looks this capacitor looks just like my

---------02:29----------
helmet did three two and a half weeks

---------02:32----------
ago all right that capacitor is now off

---------02:39----------
of the board now we're gonna see if we

---------02:41----------
still have a short two grounds on our pp

---------02:42----------
bus let's go back over to where our BP

---------02:46----------
bus is one probe on ground the other

---------02:49----------
probe on the side of the fuse and we get

---------02:51----------
yeah it's going back ups into the

---------02:54----------
kilohms which means that there is no

---------02:56----------
longer a short to ground on the PP bus

---------02:58----------
which means that we can now safely

---------03:00----------
remove that fuse and put a proper

---------03:02----------
capacitor where the capacitor goes so

---------03:05----------
this fuse is done for let's see we're

---------03:07----------
not gonna replace the fuse without

---------03:08----------
knowing why the fuse blew

---------03:23----------
we have to figure out why the fuse blew

---------03:25----------
before we replace it if you simply go oh

---------03:27----------
look the fuse is blown and replace it

---------03:28----------
without figuring out why it blew you're

---------03:30----------
just gonna keep going back to the same

---------03:32----------
place over and over and over again this

---------03:36----------
is the exact thing which makes me wonder

---------03:37----------
why my MacBook has been in our pair shop

---------03:38----------
for two months when Lois finds an issue

---------03:40----------
with a random board is able to fix it in

---------03:41----------
less than an hour well I don't always

---------03:43----------
fix the issue in less than an hour

---------03:44----------
there are many boards that I can't

---------03:46----------
figure out for long periods of time that

---------03:48----------
our total nightmares some are easy some

---------03:50----------
are total messes the thing is when it is

---------03:53----------
a total mess do you just give up and

---------03:55----------
tell the customer I give up or do you

---------03:56----------
spend months and months on it creating

---------03:59----------
an angry customer when you could have

---------04:00----------
created a happy customer by just telling

---------04:02----------
them sorry there's not much I can do the

---------04:04----------
issue is is then if you tell the

---------04:05----------
customer I'm sorry there's not much I

---------04:07----------
can do

---------04:07----------
and because you can't figure it out and

---------04:09----------
it's a difficult issue and they take it

---------04:11----------
somewhere else that does figure it out

---------04:13----------
then you've got a 1-star of you saying I

---------04:15----------
took it to these idiots and they

---------04:16----------
couldn't figure it out and the other

---------04:17----------
place could figure it out but then if

---------04:19----------
you take forever to try to figure the

---------04:20----------
issue out and can't then you get a

---------04:21----------
one-star review saying they had my

---------04:23----------
computer for two months and needed

---------04:25----------
nothing it's like one way or the other

---------04:27----------
sometimes is the shop owner you can be

---------04:28----------
screwed that's just the shop owners side

---------04:31----------
of it or maybe the place you took it to

---------04:33----------
are genuinely idiots I have no idea who

---------04:35----------
you took it to I can't vouch for them so

---------04:37----------
I have and I don't know your situation

---------04:38----------
maybe you took it to a place that are

---------04:42----------
filled with idiots or maybe your machine

---------04:43----------
has a very very difficult issue to solve

---------04:47----------
yes

---------04:49----------
capacitor capacitor

---------05:03----------
and with this tip this hiring tip is

---------05:05----------
actually so big that I can't really fit

---------05:07----------
in there while looking in the microscope

---------05:11----------
but we'll make it work that's what we do

---------05:13----------
here

---------05:15----------
better than switching over to a

---------05:17----------
different tip which would take like nine

---------05:18----------
seconds of time screw that and listening

---------05:22----------
to that damn thing beep to hell if I'm

---------05:26----------
listening to that thing beep all right

---------05:31----------
then that's great be scraping that I did

---------05:34----------
it's not something you can do on an

---------05:35----------
iPhone board you do that an iPhone board

---------05:36----------
and it's gone I have 90 people watching

---------05:38----------
this right now on the Canadian army base

---------05:40----------
here really Wow

---------05:45----------
there are people watching in class no

---------05:48----------
way

---------05:48----------
let's get another MacBook that I can

---------05:50----------
steal that capacitor and fuse from

---------06:23----------
that is flux for the person who asked

---------06:26----------
what I put on the joints you look up a

---------06:28----------
YouTube video on what is flow that I did

---------06:30----------
what is flux or what is that gooey

---------06:31----------
liquid on the board why short-circuited

---------06:34----------
to ground because instead of the circuit

---------06:36----------
going instead of it going all the way

---------06:37----------
through it's your good advice any ideas

---------06:41----------
on how usually outgoing guy in school

---------06:43----------
can be less nervous talking to a girl he

---------06:44----------
likes any idea that now are usually

---------06:47----------
outgoing guidance what can be less

---------06:48----------
nervous talking to a girl he likes

---------06:49----------
well the for it that's a death that's a

---------06:53----------
tough one here's that you you just kind

---------06:55----------
of have to see them as a regular person

---------06:56----------
you know don't talk to them as somebody

---------06:58----------
you're trying to get a relationship out

---------07:00----------
of don't talk to them like somebody

---------07:01----------
you're trying to get a date out of or

---------07:03----------
even a conversation out of just yeah you

---------07:06----------
know talk like a normal human being

---------07:08----------
there has to be something going on that

---------07:10----------
is interesting around you and don't care

---------07:12----------
what the outcome is that's another big

---------07:14----------
part of it just don't care what the

---------07:15----------
outcome is just walk up and go hi so

---------07:18----------
what do you think of this or he said

---------07:20----------
that about something you know something

---------07:22----------
that's going on in school or whatever

---------07:23----------
and see what their if they're interested

---------07:25----------
in talking if they are interested in

---------07:27----------
talking then great if they're not

---------07:29----------
interested in talking then it

---------07:31----------
because you don't care what the outcome

---------07:32----------
is if you care what the outcome is

---------07:33----------
you're nervous if you're nervous you'll

---------07:36----------
have a shitty conversation if you have a

---------07:37----------
shitty conversation you have no chance

---------07:39----------
of getting the girl if you're not

---------07:40----------
nervous and you don't care what the

---------07:42----------
outcome is then well I don't know maybe

---------07:45----------
then you have a 10% chance of getting

---------07:46----------
the girl or 1% of your mate but

---------07:48----------
10-person your videos or red pills to

---------07:51----------
Mac fanboys are they thank you now the

---------07:56----------
thing is you may still you have to

---------07:58----------
accept the outcome for whatever it is

---------08:00----------
you have to know that whatever it is

---------08:01----------
that occurs you have to accept that

---------08:03----------
whatever occurs whatever the outcome is

---------08:05----------
that would that is the best possible

---------08:06----------
outcome that it could have been and not

---------08:10----------
get because the thing is when you're

---------08:11----------
nervous you're not accepting that the

---------08:12----------
best possible outcome is what is what

---------08:14----------
occurs because when you're nervous

---------08:15----------
you're thinking to yourself well I'm not

---------08:17----------
gonna speak because what if what if

---------08:19----------
later is a better time to speak or what

---------08:20----------
if later I have a better thing to say

---------08:22----------
and blahdy blahdy blah yeah don't do

---------08:24----------
that

---------08:24----------
because if you do that then that means

---------08:26----------
that you're not accepting that whatever

---------08:27----------
occurs if you're being honest and you're

---------08:29----------
being open and you're being interesting

---------08:31----------
and you're being yourself is the best

---------08:32----------
possible thing that could have happened

---------08:33----------
maybe she looks at you and says oh like

---------08:37----------
I'm not

---------08:37----------
than that or why you talking to me about

---------08:39----------
this and if that occurs well then that's

---------08:41----------
the best possible thing that could have

---------08:42----------
happened and you're talking to somebody

---------08:43----------
that you shouldn't be talking to

---------08:45----------
anyway and only one way to find out

---------08:46----------
right only one way to find out why do

---------08:53----------
you call it short it's a ground I call

---------08:54----------
that short it's a ground because rather

---------08:55----------
than the voltage making its way to every

---------08:57----------
part of the system it stops short over

---------08:59----------
here so this here is my motherboard this

---------09:02----------
here is my motherboard P P bus g3 hot is

---------09:05----------
created here it's supposed to go all the

---------09:08----------
way around the system because this pp

---------09:10----------
bus g3 hot that's needed here and

---------09:12----------
everything but this capacitor is stuck

---------09:14----------
going to ground when it's not supposed

---------09:15----------
to

---------09:15----------
so rather than the voltage making its

---------09:17----------
way from here all the way over here

---------09:18----------
that's the long trip it's making the

---------09:21----------
short trip which is from here to here

---------09:24----------
and then getting sent to ground so

---------09:25----------
instead of the voltage making this trip

---------09:27----------
it's making this trip this is shorter

---------09:29----------
than this the end what is it shorted to

---------09:31----------
to ground because that's what we had

---------09:34----------
zero resistance to we had zero

---------09:35----------
resistance between pp bus and ground so

---------09:38----------
pp bus was shorted meaning it's taking a

---------09:40----------
shorter trip than it's supposed to to

---------09:42----------
ground that's what I mean by a shorted

---------09:45----------
to ground now people use the term short

---------09:47----------
to mean just about anything that's wrong

---------09:49----------
with anything nowadays which obviously

---------09:50----------
is incorrect and it's yeah the shorted

---------09:57----------
is used as a noun and a verb and

---------09:58----------
everything when it's not needed to do

---------09:59----------
some of you don't be the guy who dies in

---------10:01----------
dashes after ordering the most expensive

---------10:03----------
items in the menu nobody does that

---------10:05----------
are you still single Louis I am indeed

---------10:06----------
single so you should not be taking my

---------10:08----------
dating tips because most of the people

---------10:10----------
that I ask out if not all don't say yes

---------10:12----------
and my relationships are all entire

---------10:15----------
messes and cluster facts

---------10:16----------
so take my advice with a grain of salt I

---------10:19----------
am almost 30 and I am single so perhaps

---------10:24----------
my advice is terrible

---------10:25----------
apparently walking up to them and

---------10:26----------
talking about my pp bus just doesn't

---------10:29----------
this just doesn't get things done

---------10:38----------
not peepee bus is 8 point 5 volts not

---------10:41----------
8.1 volts my peepee bus was eight point

---------10:47----------
one volts until I met you girl I'm sure

---------10:54----------
they just haven't read the schematic yet

---------10:55----------
if they did they'd be all over me girl

---------11:02----------
you make my fan spin round round round

---------11:04----------
round I was just about to plug a USB C

---------11:08----------
charger into this Wow that was dumb

---------11:10----------
that's almost as dumb as 90% of my

---------11:13----------
pickup lines all right we're gonna take

---------11:15----------
this plug it in and we get a fan spin

---------11:21----------
look at that fan spin fan spent our

---------11:28----------
short to ground has been fixed the pp

---------11:31----------
bus has been restored the pp bus has

---------11:34----------
been restored that's all we could ever

---------11:36----------
ask for

---------11:37----------
so with that let's move on to the next

---------11:40----------
motherboard pp bus has been restored
