alright let's see what's wrong with

---------00:01----------
today's MacBook today's MacBook appears

---------00:05----------
to have an issue with the logic board

---------00:07----------
you know but up this MacBook and see

---------00:09----------
what's going on with it just get this

---------00:15----------
little MacBook open try to remove the

---------00:21----------
bottom of this without cutting the skin

---------00:24----------
on my fingers Oh cut the skin on my

---------00:29----------
fingers again hate this piece of crap

---------00:31----------
macbook design and what's going on with

---------00:34----------
you little MacBook its first thing we're

---------00:36----------
gonna do is we're gonna unplug the

---------00:37----------
battery if the battery's plugged in the

---------00:41----------
battery is plugged into the MacBook then

---------00:44----------
we won't quite be getting the reading we

---------00:49----------
want from our USB see at meter I don't

---------00:52----------
want to see how much power the battery

---------00:53----------
is drawing as it charges because that's

---------00:55----------
a variable amount it's gonna be

---------00:56----------
different depending on how charged the

---------00:57----------
battery is I want to see what the board

---------01:00----------
is taking by itself only that is the

---------01:02----------
number that I care about so we're gonna

---------01:04----------
plug this into this little USB see

---------01:07----------
MacBook and see what it takes this

---------01:12----------
MacBook is drawing 300 milliamps of 5.18

---------01:17----------
volts it's not negotiating twenty volts

---------01:20----------
with the charger which means we have an

---------01:23----------
issue with our cd32 15 s or PP 3v3

---------01:26----------
underscore g3 hot is not present one way

---------01:30----------
to find out let's get this board out of

---------01:35----------
this MacBook and see if we can fix it

---------01:37----------
the problem with this MacBook as it

---------01:39----------
wasn't negotiating 20 volts with a

---------01:42----------
charger and when we plug in the charger

---------01:44----------
you'll see

---------01:50----------
that wasn't now it's not showing

---------01:52----------
anything at all Wow

---------01:56----------
much sadness so one charging port

---------02:00----------
doesn't work at all and the other

---------02:03----------
charging port is stuck at five volts so

---------02:07----------
Paul says it was dropped in the charge

---------02:09----------
cable and then it shorted and broke if

---------02:11----------
this used a MagSafe for charging you

---------02:13----------
could drop the machine on the charger

---------02:15----------
and it wouldn't matter because the

---------02:16----------
charger would become detached from the

---------02:17----------
motherboard but oh we don't have that

---------02:23----------
anymore now do we in order for the

---------02:26----------
charger to talk to the computer we need

---------02:28----------
PP 3 V 3 underscore g3 hot so that the

---------02:31----------
cd32 15 s can do their job let's see if

---------02:35----------
they're getting P P 3 P 3 underscore g3

---------02:37----------
HOD also Paul s is in the chat everybody

---------02:39----------
say hi to Paul who's gonna be replacing

---------02:41----------
some MacBook CPUs over the next few

---------02:43----------
weeks I'm quite excited to start doing

---------02:45----------
macbook cpu repair that's gonna be fun

---------02:48----------
we have two point seven volts at P P 3 V

---------02:50----------
3 underscore g3 hot cuz this is the port

---------02:54----------
that's not doing anything so that's

---------02:56----------
gonna be the right CD 32 15 if we look

---------02:58----------
up here so there's the left one on the

---------03:00----------
bottom and let me see this is the top

---------03:03----------
port this is the bottom port down here

---------03:06----------
and when I click here it goes to that

---------03:08----------
alright so first thing we do is remove

---------03:11----------
the bad CD 3215 I'm assuming that this

---------03:14----------
is a bad CD 3215 I'm not really sure

---------03:26----------
[Applause]

---------04:01----------

MacBooks I just interrupted my damn good

---------04:41----------

---------04:47----------
videos you said you didn't like Razer

---------04:48----------

---------04:51----------
apple of pcs lots of issues with the

---------04:59----------
board very expensive

---------05:13----------
trust in any of these cd32 15 we're

---------05:17----------
taking new ones

---------05:28----------
the demand for gugak has gone up so much

---------05:30----------

---------05:31----------
hundreds more of them we can't keep up

---------05:34----------

---------09:03----------
milliamps that port wasn't working at

---------09:06----------
all before

---------09:13----------
my bottom port is giving me five point

---------09:15----------
22 volts and boot looping

---------09:24----------
and now it's giving me 20 volts at 500

---------09:26----------
milliamps

---------09:37----------
boot boot boot boot show me an Apple

---------09:48----------
logo fixed yet another dead MacBook that

---------10:00----------
MacBook was having an issue where we

---------10:03----------
were stuck at 5 volts on the US we were

---------10:06----------
stuck at 5 volts on the USBC charge or

---------10:09----------
even though pp3 v3 underscore g3 hunt

---------10:11----------
was present we replaced those CD 32 15s

---------10:15----------

---------10:16----------
remember folks CD 3 2 2 1 5 a CD 3 2 1 5

---------10:20----------
B and C D 32 1 5 C are not compatible

---------10:24----------
