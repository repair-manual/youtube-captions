---------00:00----------
okay so this looks like an eight to zero

---------00:01----------
thirty seven eighty seven board and I

---------00:05----------
plug it in but it's dead plugged in and

---------00:08----------
there's no fan spin see sad fan not

---------00:13----------
spinning so the first thing I'm gonna do

---------00:15----------
before anything else is I'm gonna unplug

---------00:18----------
this right i/o board because the right

---------00:19----------
i/o board can keep it from turning on

---------00:21----------
let's get that done okay plug it in we

---------00:26----------
still get zero amp usage drop all right

---------00:29----------
so let's unplug everything from it and

---------00:31----------
see if we get any change the keyboard

---------00:33----------
can keep it from turning on plug it in

---------00:37----------
and when we plug it in its drawing 1.6

---------00:40----------
amps so we're gonna plug the keyboard

---------00:43----------
back in and see if that is the cause of

---------00:48----------
our problem plug it back in dead

---------00:56----------
unplug keyboard reset power supply turns

---------01:02----------
on here's something to realize about

---------01:06----------
Apple products and this is something

---------01:07----------
that's pretty particularly specific to

---------01:10----------
Apple products with Apple products the

---------01:12----------
power button is integrated into the

---------01:14----------
keyboard many other machines have the

---------01:16----------
power button separate from the keyboard

---------01:18----------
on a separate circuit this way if you've

---------01:20----------
managed to spill liquid on your keyboard

---------01:22----------
only the keyboard will stop working not

---------01:25----------
the entire laptop Apple however is

---------01:27----------
special the power button is integrated

---------01:29----------
into the keyboard itself so if you spill

---------01:32----------
water on your Z key your power key will

---------01:34----------
stop working if your power key stops

---------01:36----------
working and is always pressed the

---------01:40----------
machine will think that you're resetting

---------01:42----------
the SMC and it won't turn on this is a

---------01:44----------
feature that is unique to Apple products

---------01:47----------
so you won't be able to just plug in an

---------01:49----------
external five dollar USB keyboard you

---------01:51----------
have lying around and use that to get

---------01:52----------
your data before you fix it Yuda screwed

---------01:55----------
this is where the keyboard plugs in j48

---------01:58----------
13 right over here on pin 5 you have WS

---------02:00----------
keyboard on/off l if you spill something

---------02:04----------
on the keyboard you may wind up shorting

---------02:07----------
WS keyboard on/off l to ground

---------02:09----------
constantly even if you only spilled it

---------02:12----------
on a key that was not the power button

---------02:13----------
which is going to keep the machine from

---------02:15----------
turning on what would make sense is to

---------02:17----------
have a separate circuit for the power

---------02:19----------
button I know they want to slim down the

---------02:21----------
machine and I don't want to streamline

---------02:22----------
and simplify it but this is the circuit

---------02:25----------
responsible for turning it on

---------02:28----------
give us a separate circuit with a button

---------02:31----------
so that if you get a drop of water on

---------02:33----------
your enter or your Zeki you just have a

---------02:36----------
broken enter or Zeki or a bad keyboard

---------02:39----------
not a dead computer integrating the

---------02:42----------
power button into the entirety of the

---------02:45----------
keyboard is mean unnecessary lame
