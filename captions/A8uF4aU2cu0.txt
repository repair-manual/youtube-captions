---------00:00----------
hi so today we're going to be going over

---------00:01----------
a machine for mr. mayor so this was sent

---------00:03----------
in with the no backlight issue and we

---------00:07----------
have some funny funky going on here

---------00:10----------
there's like there's a keyboard cable

---------00:12----------
that's like going above the board below

---------00:14----------
the battery and all wrapped up I will

---------00:18----------
yeah I will let's let's figure out

---------00:20----------
what's wrong with the backlight issue

---------00:22----------
first and maybe I'll with that

---------00:25----------
keyboard mess a little later so let's

---------00:29----------
turn it on and confirm problem confirm

---------00:31----------
what's going on with it before we do

---------00:33----------
anything so we turn it on chimes yay

---------00:40----------
let's see if I have a picture on the

---------00:43----------
screen so one of the easiest ways to do

---------00:46----------
that with a retina is with an LED ring

---------00:48----------
light from an old microscope so you just

---------00:50----------
take that ring light and you put it by

---------00:53----------
the Apple see this is one of those

---------00:58----------
things now because you know you got to

---------01:00----------
be careful when you're doing this you

---------01:01----------
got to be careful is this aim the same

---------01:03----------
no backlight this is no image there

---------01:11----------
ain't on the screen see so a lot of

---------01:19----------
people will think oh the problem is that

---------01:22----------
I don't have a light on the screen when

---------01:24----------
the actual problem is that this screen

---------01:26----------
has no picture or that the screen is not

---------01:28----------
recognized these are different problems

---------01:30----------
and then you get even further down the

---------01:32----------
rabbit hole where people are calling it

---------01:33----------
you know nothing on the screen or no

---------01:35----------
backlight when there's no vcore and

---------01:36----------
there's no actual power going at the CPU

---------01:38----------
this chimes so since the charms it tells

---------01:41----------
me that at the very least the CPU is

---------01:42----------
working but at the moment and that

---------01:45----------
there's nothing on the screen so the

---------01:47----------
first thing here to be careful of is you

---------01:50----------
don't want to chase a no backlight

---------01:51----------
rabbit hole on a board that has no image

---------01:55----------
on the screen so the first thing we want

---------01:57----------
to do is we want to see if power is

---------01:58----------
actually getting to the LCD so let's

---------02:01----------
just switch over here to the schematic

---------02:04----------
and we can start talking about what's

---------02:06----------
going on with the screen so this is an 8

---------02:08----------
to 0 37 87 board so we're going to go

---------02:11----------
over to the LCD connector here

---------02:13----------
we're gonna see where power goes so it's

---------02:16----------
J 8300 right so let's look on the

---------02:18----------
schematic here for J 8300 you Adobe

---------02:26----------
thanks for nothing

---------02:31----------
okay take two no I don't want any

---------02:34----------
foreign funds just play my schematic I

---------02:37----------
hate being sick okay so PP 5 vs Oh LC D

---------02:43----------
5 volt rail to power the LCD that is

---------02:45----------
supposed to be coming in on pins 28 29

---------02:48----------
and 30 ignore pins 33 through 41 and

---------02:50----------
they don't exist they're just here to

---------02:52----------
 with you because Apple likes making

---------02:54----------
life miserable I think they finally

---------02:56----------
started to figure out that we have

---------02:57----------
access to these schematics and I think

---------02:59----------
one of the things they did as a as a way

---------03:01----------
to screw with us is they've just made

---------03:03----------
some of the information they're a little

---------03:04----------
bit incorrect just to make life

---------03:06----------
miserable so let's get an idea what's

---------03:08----------
going on with that so let's plug this

---------03:09----------
thing back in over here and we're gonna

---------03:13----------
measure why does one make it so that you

---------03:15----------
can see what I measure got me a little

---------03:17----------
oscilloscope alright okay we plug it in

---------03:23----------
I'm gonna take my oscilloscope probe

---------03:26----------
over here okay I can't really do much

---------03:33----------
yeah that's there we go mount it on my

---------03:35----------
on my S 5 phone screen is theory there's

---------03:38----------
no way that anything's breaking in s5 as

---------03:41----------
I like to say so I'm gonna take one

---------03:44----------
probably here put it on ground the other

---------03:46----------
probe and put it over here so we have 5

---------03:48----------
volts going to the LCD

---------03:51----------
and let's check on the pins themselves

---------03:54----------
just to make sure that I'm not losing it

---------03:57----------
so we have 5 volts going to the actual

---------03:59----------
screen hmm

---------04:01----------
let's see where backlight is supposed to

---------04:03----------
be on your shall we because that may

---------04:04----------
give us a little bit of a hint as to

---------04:05----------
what's going on so let's check back

---------04:09----------
light is on pin one it's called PPV out

---------04:14----------
underscore s ou underscore LCD backlight

---------04:17----------
right ok so let's see where that shows

---------04:20----------
up on this board so we should be able to

---------04:22----------
see that on a bunch of these capacitors

---------04:24----------
over here so let's measure it and again

---------04:26----------
I'm not expecting to see anything I'm

---------04:28----------
just curious I'm just curious because

---------04:29----------
different levels of voltage can say

---------04:31----------
different things are wrong now if you

---------04:34----------
get 0 volts

---------04:35----------
maybe a blown fuse you get you get 12

---------04:40----------
volts okay it's it's it the least power

---------04:42----------
is going through but it's not boosting

---------04:43----------
you get 60 or 50 volts the problem there

---------04:46----------
is that it's not problem if you get 50

---------04:51----------
or 60 is that it may not see the screen

---------04:52----------
is actually connected so the problem

---------04:55----------
there would be the line from backlight

---------04:58----------
output backlight booze to the LCD

---------05:00----------
connector so here we have 0 volts on

---------05:02----------
backlight which speaks to maybe an issue

---------05:06----------
with fuse another thing to think about

---------05:08----------
the retinas and again this is something

---------05:10----------
that you should know because it's a it's

---------05:12----------
a common mistake and common problem so I

---------05:14----------
said a lot of people think that there's

---------05:15----------
no backlight when there's no video

---------05:16----------
another problem with the retina is

---------05:18----------
people do the opposite because they they

---------05:20----------
think there's no image when there is

---------05:21----------
when there is when there's no backlight

---------05:23----------
present because it is so hard to see the

---------05:25----------
screen on a retina without a light I

---------05:26----------
don't know what they did or what type of

---------05:28----------
different screen materials get used in

---------05:29----------
these newer model screens but without

---------05:31----------
the without the light there you damn

---------05:34----------
near can't see anything so since it is

---------05:36----------
sending 5 volts and again I want to show

---------05:37----------
you a little bit of how this works to

---------05:38----------
see them you have an idea the way this

---------05:41----------
works see this PP 5 ESO LCD this is not

---------05:45----------
going to come in without LCD power

---------05:46----------
enable being there LCD power and Nabal

---------05:50----------
comes from let's show you here

---------05:57----------
this comes from you let's see you have

---------06:01----------
your 9600 is one of the places that

---------06:04----------
you'll find it okay so you 9600 is

---------06:17----------
amongst so you have integrated video

---------06:19----------
over here with the iris graphics but

---------06:21----------
then you also have the grab of the

---------06:24----------
graphics chip the Nvidia graphics chip

---------06:25----------
and then also you have DisplayPort here

---------06:27----------
and then you have a display port and you

---------06:29----------
have HDMI this is this is all a lot of

---------06:31----------
stuff to manage an Apple as a chip that

---------06:32----------
manages it now

---------06:34----------
this sees the graphics this sees that

---------06:36----------
there's a screen there

---------06:37----------
hey this is obviously sees that there's

---------06:39----------
a screen there if it didn't see that

---------06:40----------
there was a screen there it would not be

---------06:42----------
showing you it five volts there would

---------06:44----------
not be sending out that signal to allow

---------06:45----------
5 volts to go through and we use

---------06:48----------
something called it is a D DC circuit

---------06:51----------
that detects that there's actually that

---------06:54----------
there's a screen there that's

---------06:55----------
responsible for detecting it so you know

---------06:56----------
when you plug in a VGA monitor or a DVI

---------06:58----------
monitor in the computer then magically

---------07:00----------
knows oh hey there's a monitor there oh

---------07:02----------
hey that's a 1600 by 900 or a 1600 by

---------07:04----------
1200 screen that's part of something

---------07:07----------
called a DD C MOC circuit so that's what

---------07:09----------
you're looking at over here anyway long

---------07:11----------
story short if we see 5 volts at the LCD

---------07:14----------
LCD being detected is not the problem

---------07:16----------
most likely it is a backlight problem

---------07:18----------
and the only issue here is that I

---------07:20----------
thought I didn't see a picture because

---------07:22----------
I'm sick and going blind so let's go

---------07:25----------
back oh you couldn't see me oh well no

---------07:29----------
big loss I'm sick anyway and I'm not

---------07:31----------
that handsome so we're good let's check

---------07:33----------
the rest of the backlight circuit so PPV

---------07:37----------
out LCD backlight where are we

---------07:41----------
okay so first it starts this is a

---------07:45----------
standard DC to DC boost circuit the way

---------07:48----------
this works is you're going to have let's

---------07:51----------
make sure that you see what I see

---------07:52----------
alright you have a certain low DC

---------07:55----------
voltage going through here right now

---------07:57----------
this is going to open based on other

---------08:00----------
signals and I'm not going to get into

---------08:02----------
that right now

---------08:03----------
but this is a transistor that's simply

---------08:05----------
going to let power through to the

---------08:06----------
backlight sir now the way this is gonna

---------08:08----------
work I have experience playing this in

---------08:09----------
the DC to DC booth circuit video is you

---------08:12----------
can only get in power to move through an

---------08:13----------
inductor so fast so what's going to

---------08:15----------
happen here when you short it to ground

---------08:17----------
is that the power can't move through it

---------08:18----------
as fast as at once and it's gonna build

---------08:20----------
up in certain areas and you're gonna

---------08:23----------
have this like stopping short effect

---------08:25----------
we're at one certain point in the

---------08:26----------
inductor you get instead of having 12

---------08:28----------
volts you're gonna have 15 because you

---------08:29----------
have this coil right this coil that can

---------08:31----------
store power and if you try to shove all

---------08:34----------
that power through it as fast as you can

---------08:35----------
it's not gonna be 12 it's gonna be 12

---------08:37----------
then when it stops short 12 15 18 21

---------08:42----------
it's like showstopping short in a car

---------08:43----------
like you're driving in your car at 50

---------08:45----------
miles an hour right but you yourself

---------08:47----------
you're you're you feel stationary when

---------08:49----------
that car stops short

---------08:50----------
for one second you're probably moving at

---------08:52----------
50 miles an hour and that's it's kids

---------08:54----------
kind of like the same thing going over

---------08:55----------
here so this thing is constantly

---------08:56----------
switching constantly stopping short and

---------08:58----------
then after this diode and in these

---------09:00----------
capacitors over here you're storing the

---------09:02----------
back light energy so let's check along

---------09:04----------
every part of the back light rail and

---------09:07----------
get an idea what's going on so I'm going

---------09:08----------
to turn the machine on again and we will

---------09:10----------
start with F 7700 if we go to the board

---------09:13----------
view over here we will see where F 7700

---------09:15----------
is okay F 7700 is over there so let's

---------09:20----------
see what we have on each side of the

---------09:22----------
fuse so we're gonna measure over here

---------09:24----------
and we have on one side of this fuse we

---------09:27----------
have 13.3 volts on the other side of

---------09:29----------
this fuse we have 13.3 volts which means

---------09:32----------
that power is getting through to the

---------09:34----------
back light circuit now we're going to

---------09:35----------
check over here at Q 7706

---------09:38----------
I want to see if power is getting

---------09:40----------
through to the rest of this thing so Q

---------09:42----------
7706 let's see where that is and I'm

---------09:44----------
gonna skip over the current sensing

---------09:45----------
resistor I've gone over all current

---------09:47----------
sensing resistors are thousands of times

---------09:49----------
yeah that's over here cut there that is

---------09:52----------
that is just never the problem and watch

---------09:54----------
it be the problem here because I said

---------09:55----------
it's never the problem but 99% of the

---------09:57----------
time it's just not the problem so see

---------09:59----------
Q's 30 706 by the way I don't remember

---------10:02----------
the last time I've actually had a

---------10:03----------
backlight issue on a retina that was a

---------10:05----------
fuse it's almost never the fuse the fuse

---------10:07----------
doesn't blow the LCD connector blows the

---------10:10----------
LCD cable blows

---------10:12----------
large traces and the motherboard will

---------10:15----------
blow but the fuse oh hell no that thing

---------10:18----------
never never never never never ever the

---------10:21----------
backlight oh no no now dare Apple design

---------10:24----------
a machine where the actually works

---------10:25----------
the way it's put the hardware as you

---------10:28----------
know works the way it's supposed to

---------10:30----------
through on Jeopardy reasons ah no

---------10:32----------
we can't have that okay so now we have

---------10:35----------
voltage at the fuse right but we don't

---------10:37----------
have voltage at the after it at the end

---------10:41----------
so let's start going to region

---------10:43----------
individual components in the line so you

---------10:45----------
have Q 7706 over here right so Q 7706

---------10:53----------
it's this thing so pin six that is going

---------10:58----------
to be where we see the power on the

---------11:01----------
output so let's see if that is actually

---------11:02----------
opening and that's not opening but we

---------11:07----------
does have power on input now let's try

---------11:10----------
to learn a little bit of how a basic

---------11:12----------
transistor works now as I've said there

---------11:14----------
are different types of transistors there

---------11:16----------
are transistors where the transistor

---------11:18----------
itself will open and send power through

---------11:21----------
when you have voltage on the transistors

---------11:23----------
gate and there are transistors that will

---------11:25----------
not open when you have voltage on the

---------11:27----------
transistors gate so I can do over here

---------11:29----------
is we can Google the model number of

---------11:30----------
that transistor and see what type of

---------11:32----------
transistor this one is so FDC six three

---------11:35----------
eight a pz okay so we search for the

---------11:40----------
transistor and we get a datasheet

---------11:42----------
there's gonna be a bunch of information

---------11:44----------
here that I don't know anything about

---------11:46----------
okay so this is one of them transistors

---------11:48----------
where if you have less voltage on the

---------11:50----------
gate than you do on your source

---------11:52----------
hypothetically speaking it should open

---------11:54----------
so on pin 4 and pin 3 those are going to

---------11:56----------
be the pins are that are of interest to

---------11:58----------
me

---------11:58----------
well pins 4 and 3 so we're gonna try to

---------12:01----------
measure pin 4 up here so pin 4 of this

---------12:08----------
transistor as 13 volts and pin 3

---------12:16----------
transistor is 12.4 so there's a good

---------12:19----------
reason that this is not opening so this

---------12:23----------
is not opening because there it is

---------12:25----------
saturated so over here this is saturated

---------12:28----------
so now there are a couple of things that

---------12:30----------
I'm gonna think are to blame now the way

---------12:32----------
this works again so this over here this

---------12:35----------
takes twelve point six volts and sends

---------12:37----------
it right over here to the transistors

---------12:38----------
gate however in order to get that volts

---------12:41----------
to drop you have our 7702 here which is

---------12:44----------
going to backlight SD now this over here

---------12:48----------
should short to ground to allow this

---------12:50----------
voltage divider to work to take voltage

---------12:52----------
off of the gate so that this P channel

---------12:54----------
MOSFET over here can let the power

---------12:56----------
through to the rest of the machine

---------12:57----------
however it's not happening why is that

---------12:59----------
not happening I'm not sure yet maybe

---------13:02----------
this chip is bad internally or maybe

---------13:05----------
it's simply not being sent a signal to

---------13:07----------
it now let's see a little bit more about

---------13:09----------
how this chip works so you have this

---------13:10----------
thing over here called en well why I

---------13:12----------
wonder what en means maybe that means

---------13:14----------
enable maybe that's why it's not enabled

---------13:17----------
is there voltage on the enable pin is

---------13:20----------
this actually going to ground the way

---------13:22----------
it's supposed to is our seventy seven

---------13:24----------
forty two good these are all great

---------13:25----------
questions and they're all things I'd

---------13:26----------
love to start figuring out so let's see

---------13:28----------
where to use 7701 is on the board and

---------13:30----------
let's see where our 77 42 is on the

---------13:32----------
board with any other old board these are

---------13:34----------
things I have memorized but since this

---------13:35----------
is a newer Apple board I have to

---------13:37----------
actually look it up and pretend that I'm

---------13:39----------
doing it for the first time so we have

---------13:42----------
our seventy seven forty two and you 7701

---------13:46----------
our seven seven four to use seven 701

---------13:50----------
and if these are on the bottom of the

---------13:52----------
board I will scream because I don't want

---------13:54----------
to take this mess apart okay let's see

---------13:56----------
so we go over here we make it fullscreen

---------14:01----------
and that zero resistor is in the middle

---------14:09----------
oh of course you're really tiny go

---------14:13----------
figure

---------14:14----------
okay let's see what that looks like

---------14:16----------
under the microscope so we're gonna go

---------14:19----------
over here and get that under the

---------14:21----------
microscope and get a little look at what

---------14:24----------
that looks like

---------14:30----------
CLE YouTube says good night to you

---------14:52----------
a little little piece of in the

---------14:56----------
middle all right let's see how many ohms

---------15:02----------
that is

---------15:26----------
it's zero ohms like it's supposed to be

---------15:31----------
now let's see if we actually have power

---------15:33----------
present at the back light enabled tab oh

---------15:43----------
measuring that is going to be a [ __ ]

---------15:45----------
and a half

---------16:21----------
three point two volts three point two

---------16:27----------
volts um so we're gonna do something bad

---------16:37----------
right about now so you can try to figure

---------16:39----------
out what's going on so what I'm thinking

---------16:41----------
right now I got a couple of things going

---------16:44----------
on in my head the first is that this

---------16:46----------
chip is bad and even though it's getting

---------16:47----------
the enable signal it is not allowing

---------16:50----------
this voltage divider to come through it

---------16:52----------
is not allowing the SD pen over here to

---------16:54----------
switch to ground to allow this to allow

---------16:56----------
power through to the Machine the second

---------16:58----------
is that this transistor is somehow

---------17:00----------
internally damaged as a result of that

---------17:02----------
it's sending the 12 volts from the input

---------17:04----------
to the gate and then not allowing it to

---------17:05----------
go through on the source it's not

---------17:08----------
allowing needed it's not allowing this

---------17:10----------
to go to there because somehow this is

---------17:13----------
getting sent to the gate and because

---------17:15----------
that's up in some way it's not

---------17:17----------
working I also forgot to check our 7702

---------17:19----------
which is pretty stupid I actually was I

---------17:21----------
think I type that in here

---------17:23----------
r7 702 did I put that in here because

---------17:26----------
that's oh that's a really important one

---------17:28----------
over here if that doesn't work then none

---------17:30----------
of this is gonna work well let's just

---------17:32----------
may let's just check that and that

---------17:33----------
theory but the bad thing I'm gonna do

---------17:36----------
and if you watch this channel long

---------17:37----------
enough you know exactly what it is it's

---------17:39----------
I'm just going to check for a short

---------17:42----------
after this and if there is no short

---------17:44----------
after this I'm just gonna solder blob

---------17:45----------
for it or one two five six and see if

---------17:48----------
anything blows up and then go from there

---------17:50----------
and that's actually a good thing to do

---------17:52----------
now so I'm gonna check both of those

---------17:54----------
things now so the first thing I'm gonna

---------17:55----------
do is I'm going to check resistance of

---------17:57----------
our 7702

---------17:59----------
after I check the resistance of our 7702

---------18:04----------
I'm gonna check for a short to ground on

---------18:06----------
back light rail if I have another short

---------18:08----------
to ground on back light rail then I will

---------18:10----------
do something really really bad

---------18:16----------
our 7702 is sixty three point three

---------18:21----------
killer ohms this schematic says it's

---------18:24----------
supposed to be sixty three point four

---------18:26----------
killer ohms okay fast forward ahead to

---------18:29----------
the fun part let's see if there is a

---------18:31----------
short to ground on the back light rail

---------18:38----------
let's see if that is there a short to

---------18:41----------
ground on the back light rail is there a

---------18:44----------
short to ground on the back light rail

---------18:46----------
so that is dial it's that it we're gonna

---------18:51----------
measure right over here so oh yes there

---------18:55----------
is zero point zero zero two voltage drop

---------18:58----------
to ground you know what you know what

---------19:00----------
Apple this is pretty cool you

---------19:02----------
know what I don't give you credit where

---------19:04----------
credit is due but and I think I may have

---------19:06----------
even started off this video by

---------19:07----------
complaining about the design of the new

---------19:09----------
board but this is cool this really is

---------19:12----------
pretty cool

---------19:13----------
so check this out to prevent the fuse

---------19:14----------
from blowing and I may be nuts here for

---------19:17----------
firm for being wrong cuz I'm not even

---------19:19----------
done so check this out so this is short

---------19:21----------
to ground over here right now on any

---------19:23----------
older board you know exactly what would

---------19:24----------
happen the power would go through here

---------19:26----------
there'd be a short two grounds over here

---------19:28----------
which would mean that it would shove all

---------19:30----------
this 12 volts through this circuit or

---------19:32----------
whatever 50 volts is coming out of here

---------19:34----------
through this boost circuit out to these

---------19:37----------
short to ground and this fuse over here

---------19:39----------
would get completely sodomized

---------19:40----------
or if the short to ground was after here

---------19:43----------
if the short to ground was in the

---------19:45----------
connector itself then the connector

---------19:47----------
would just get burnt and crisps to

---------19:49----------
pieces the fuse itself wouldn't even

---------19:51----------
 blow even though it had sent

---------19:53----------
enough power through to blow everything

---------19:55----------
to pieces

---------19:55----------
and you wouldn't get anything to work

---------19:58----------
what happens here is this actually

---------20:00----------
senses that there's a short to ground

---------20:02----------
and says you know what we're not gonna

---------20:04----------
blow the fuse we're not gonna blow you

---------20:06----------
we're not gonna let the fuse not blow

---------20:08----------
and then destroy the connector we're

---------20:09----------
actually gonna turn this transistor off

---------20:11----------
we're gonna use this switch the way it

---------20:13----------
should have been used seven damn years

---------20:15----------
ago and we put it on the unibody boards

---------20:16----------
but like again Late Late beads never you

---------20:20----------
know what you should have done it in

---------20:21----------
2008 2015 it's about time so

---------20:25----------
let's see what's causing that short

---------20:27----------
so I'm gonna unplug the screen and when

---------20:29----------
I unplug the screen I get no short at

---------20:35----------
all okay so what I'm going to do now is

---------20:38----------
I'm going to take another retina screen

---------20:40----------
and plug that in and if another retina

---------20:42----------
screen works then I'm afraid you're just

---------20:44----------
 because you're gonna be paying a

---------20:46----------
lot of money to fix that so this is a

---------20:49----------
Retina screen from back when we used to

---------20:51----------
replace the entire assembly and replace

---------20:54----------
the entire assembly if somebody wanted

---------20:55----------
their old one back we give it to them

---------20:57----------
but most people don't want this old

---------20:58----------
stuff back so we would keep it and now

---------21:01----------
we're refurbishing all of these and yes

---------21:03----------
so I'm good I just took one to see if

---------21:06----------
this one has a backlight this went on

---------21:17----------
for a second but this one's actually too

---------21:20----------
 but the test if it has a

---------21:22----------
backlight so I'm gonna get up again and

---------21:25----------
I'm gonna get another one that looks a

---------21:27----------
little less a little less up okay

---------21:28----------
got another one I can't say this looks

---------21:30----------
less up I'm just hoping that I

---------21:32----------
picked a good one I use the incredibly

---------21:35----------
scientific method of and then stopping

---------21:38----------
my hand that I ran the point to choose

---------21:40----------
this screen versus another okay we plug

---------21:46----------
this in wait a second this is not going

---------21:57----------
to turn on the screen because I have

---------21:59----------
this thing closed well duh yeah so the

---------22:04----------
other one wasn't even up it was

---------22:05----------
just that I had the computer closed so

---------22:07----------
as you can see this actually has a

---------22:08----------
perfectly fine backlight there's nothing

---------22:11----------
for me to fix here um you just have a

---------22:14----------
messed up screen yeah yeah yeah if you

---------22:26----------
need a new one of these I don't know if

---------22:29----------
you've seen what the prices are for them

---------22:31----------
but that is and when you crack the

---------22:35----------
screen when you crack it

---------22:37----------
you need just the new LCD when the light

---------22:41----------
inside of this thing died and is

---------22:43----------
shorting itself to ground you're you're

---------22:47----------
 you need a new you need this and

---------22:52----------
yeah this this is where you get a

---------22:55----------
disheartening call from from my salesman

---------22:58----------
because I I used to deliver this type of

---------23:01----------
bad news all the time and it is it is

---------23:05----------
luckily not my job anymore

---------23:06----------
I guess I'm delivering it kind of

---------23:09----------
through YouTube

---------23:09----------
so this goes on the side so that's all

---------23:12----------
the troubleshooting done again coolest

---------23:14----------
thing to make note of on these new

---------23:15----------
retina boards on the newest on the a20

---------23:17----------
37 87 I gotta say I gotta give some

---------23:20----------
props to Apple and props who do I've

---------23:22----------
been sitting here on this channel

---------23:24----------
bitching for the past three years and

---------23:26----------
how all their products are made like

---------23:27----------
 even the ones that are usable I'm

---------23:29----------
not gonna say that they're that they're

---------23:30----------
bad for everybody

---------23:31----------
Apple products are very usable for a lot

---------23:33----------
of people and there's a lot of things

---------23:35----------
with the software that make it easier to

---------23:36----------
get things done the hardware itself you

---------23:38----------
may like the way it looks but the inside

---------23:40----------
of the machine I'm not talking about the

---------23:42----------
processing power or the speed or any of

---------23:43----------
that I'm talking about just pure

---------23:45----------
durability is usually this computer

---------23:48----------
if it senses it tells that there is a

---------23:51----------
short to ground I detected the screen I

---------23:54----------
acknowledge the screen but since there

---------23:55----------
is a short to ground on the back light

---------23:57----------
rail let's not send power through not

---------24:00----------
let's blow a fuse that other people have

---------24:02----------
to learn at a fix not let's send the

---------24:04----------
power through the fuse and ignore the

---------24:06----------
fact that the fuse exists like and all

---------24:08----------
the AIF I mean all the a14 twenty-fives

---------24:10----------
all the early eight 1398 they just did

---------24:13----------
they just say sodomize that LCD

---------24:15----------
connector they destroy it completely

---------24:17----------
none of that nonsense while while leave

---------24:19----------
a letter letting the fuse sit perfectly

---------24:20----------
fine

---------24:21----------
it actually detects that there's a short

---------24:23----------
and says you know what don't send power

---------24:25----------
there that's pretty damn cool you know I

---------24:28----------
may not like Apple but I'm fair I'll

---------24:30----------
give credit where credit is due and this

---------24:32----------
this board is a step towards a more

---------24:34----------
sustainable and a more durable design

---------24:35----------
and whoever at Apple was responsible for

---------24:38----------
putting this together they just they

---------24:39----------
deserve a raise

---------24:40----------
deserve props this is good
