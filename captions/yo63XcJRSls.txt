---------00:00----------
yes hello hello hello what can we do for

---------00:08----------
you hi hi it's just Louise no what can

---------00:11----------
we do for but I would help him with the

---------00:17----------
problem he's got no it's not here yeah

---------00:26----------
he's going on about the problems he's

---------00:30----------
having with manufacturer versus me bill

---------00:33----------
vs. all these other things and he's

---------00:36----------
approach it from the wrong angle there's

---------00:38----------
already several industries out there

---------00:41----------
that have long established a

---------00:44----------
manufacturer rebuild a manufacturer that

---------00:49----------
it has set a long-term precedent that

---------00:53----------
present prevent you from being sued or

---------00:56----------
anything else like that and I want to

---------00:57----------
discuss it with it yeah all right no

---------01:02----------
thank you very much for the call really

---------01:03----------
appreciate I'm sure you won't take my

---------01:06----------
number uh more MacBooks

---------01:11----------
oh no another MacBook no no not another

---------01:22----------
MacBook No so we don't get a green light

---------01:33----------
in the charger and there's no fan spin

---------01:36----------
so we're gonna check and see if peepees

---------01:38----------
free before it too is present now pp3

---------01:41----------
before to is created by you 70-90 this

---------01:47----------
is gonna take power from either its mark

---------01:50----------
you know you know one cue 7010 opens

---------01:56----------
gonna take power from the charger and

---------01:58----------
send it to this diode there's a fuse on

---------02:04----------
each side which is gonna be represented

---------02:05----------
by a resistor you have one fuse for

---------02:08----------
power from the battery of the other who

---------02:11----------
power from the charger now since they

---------02:13----------
can input

---------02:13----------
the battery of the charger you don't

---------02:15----------
want power from the charger to go

---------02:16----------
directly to the battery which is why I

---------02:17----------
have this dual diode configuration here

---------02:19----------
this chip is then turned on by a heavy

---------02:21----------
voltage being present at the shutdown

---------02:23----------
pin as long as you have more than

---------02:24----------
anything 2 volts at the shdn which

---------02:26----------
stands for shutdown without a vowel via

---------02:28----------
our 7080 it will automatically turn the

---------02:30----------
chip on and that it does not shut down

---------02:33----------
remember this is underscore ell meaning

---------02:36----------
shut down when it's low so when this

---------02:39----------
signal is low underscore ell isn't zero

---------02:42----------
volts chip will not turn on and then

---------02:45----------
it's going to do the switch new rule and

---------02:49----------
capacitors to ground right here and then

---------02:52----------
you're gonna get PP 3 V 4 2 so let's see

---------02:54----------
if we get P P 3 V 4 2 1 l 7095 we get

---------03:00----------
nothing 208 millivolts now what's this

---------03:07----------
but I'm supposed to have a resistor it

---------03:11----------
seems it's gone I wonder what that says

---------03:13----------
on here yeah I'm sorry

---------03:19----------
hmm our 7080 is the resistor that's

---------03:22----------
gonna go between the input and the

---------03:24----------
shutdown pin now we could get up and get

---------03:28----------
a resistor but I feel like going back to

---------03:31----------
sleep in my chair so we're gonna do it

---------03:37----------
is something like more like this yeah

---------03:41----------
fine see your ohm resistor is a wire

---------03:44----------
right this I have to get up together

---------03:49----------
resistor yes yes do you

---------04:40----------
sleepytime

---------04:45----------
Larry sharp wins the governor's race

---------04:47----------
maybe I'll be able to go to sleep again

---------04:52----------
sure we'd like to go to sleep again

---------05:05----------
you're not gonna burn the Wi-Fi antenna

---------05:07----------
we're not gonna burn the Wi-Fi antenna

---------05:09----------
we're not gonna burn the Wi-Fi antenna

---------05:11----------
we're totally not gonna burn the Wi-Fi

---------05:14----------
antenna because we're half-asleep

---------05:20----------
no driving half-asleep no driving drunk

---------05:26----------
exercise at the gym

---------05:28----------
still kisses with saliva

---------05:39----------
we're half the way there there's a green

---------05:43----------
light on the charger now an orange light

---------05:46----------
see that MacBook start work

---------05:53----------
fortunately MacBook still needs to be

---------05:57----------
fixed

---------06:00----------
eight point six volts on our pp bus

---------06:08----------
why are you still dead MacBook if you're

---------06:13----------
still dead that means I still have to

---------06:14----------
work someone says I remember used to be

---------06:16----------
against mgtow MacBooks generally take

---------06:21----------
owner's wealth no I've been I've been

---------06:25----------
preaching that for a long time I've been

---------06:27----------
telling people for over almost almost 10

---------06:29----------
years now that MacBooks will take your

---------06:31----------
money when you shouldn't buy them but

---------06:35----------
the thing is people don't listen to me

---------06:37----------
when I say that nobody takes me

---------06:38----------
seriously and they keep buying them and

---------06:41----------
then complaining when condensation kills

---------06:45----------
them I told you so mouthful but you

---------06:52----------
decided to keep buying those MacBooks

---------07:00----------
our TC chip corrosion attack if they

---------07:07----------
stop buying them then you're out of a

---------07:09----------
job yes and then I can finally get some

---------07:11----------
sleep I could use some sleep I'm tired

---------07:18----------
you know how long I've been reviving

---------07:23----------
crap books for

---------07:35----------
I've been reviving crap books for a long

---------07:37----------
time man

---------07:41----------
 tops

---------07:46----------
garbage

---------07:53----------
it's abortion of a technology

---------08:02----------
you little

---------08:06----------
yeah this is definitely not gonna have a

---------08:09----------
backlight if I don't fix that look at

---------08:13----------
that LED driver it just done itself

---------09:27----------
you still don't turn on his BP 5vs5

---------09:35----------
present on this MacBook

---------09:44----------
yes it is is pp5 es4 present on this

---------09:48----------
macbook it is not the enable is not

---------09:52----------
present PP 3v3 s5 is present PPV RTC is

---------10:01----------
present though the RTC chip does look

---------10:03----------
like it took a that's important

---------12:33----------
here we go clock chip was miss causing

---------12:35----------
our p.m. sleeve s4l to be missing so now

---------12:38----------
we have a spinning fan so check that out

---------12:41----------
the clock chip can actually cause p.m.

---------12:44----------
sleep s4l to be missing even if the RTC

---------12:46----------
voltage is present so even if RTC

---------12:49----------
voltage is present one of the things he

---------12:50----------
may have noticed is that this was the

---------12:53----------
pin that was broken right down here

---------12:56----------
there was only half a pad

---------12:59----------
this is pen twelve is for the PCH 32

---------13:04----------
kilohertz clock signal and that is going

---------13:05----------
to go to the CPU the PCH side of the CPU

---------13:08----------
over here it's important that's

---------13:13----------
important so you need your 32 kilohertz

---------13:15----------
clock you don't have your 32 killer it's

---------13:17----------
clock it won't work

---------13:19----------
so I should go back to some of the

---------13:20----------
boards that I said f it to and you never

---------13:23----------
know maybe they have a bad clock chip by

---------13:25----------
the way if you need a clock chip if you

---------13:28----------
need a clock chip and you're not sure

---------13:30----------
where to get a clock chip look no

---------13:33----------
further

---------13:34----------
store dot Rosman group.com don't delay

---------13:41----------
by today and you can get chips just like

---------13:46----------
these it'll tell you what's compatible

---------13:49----------
with your board it'll show you a picture

---------13:52----------
of what it looks like in high resolution

---------13:53----------
of both sides it'll give you the list of

---------13:56----------
comes it's compatible with you can even

---------13:59----------
ask product questions that will be

---------14:00----------
answered by other members or you can

---------14:03----------
live chat and talk to a tech or you can

---------14:06----------
contact us or you can read about us or

---------14:09----------
you can just look at our reviews and see

---------14:13----------
how awesome we are because we are that

---------14:16----------
awesome 4.9 overall rating you're not

---------14:20----------
gonna find that anywhere else nope this

---------14:23----------
is the best place you can go to buy

---------14:26----------
these parts don't delay buy today

---------14:43----------
a Russian Air Group is this rossmann

---------14:51----------
Lewis Rothman how can we often repair

---------14:54----------
group yeah I just called they're like

---------14:57----------
two seconds ago to offer my help and you

---------14:59----------
didn't even like take my phone number so

---------15:01----------
I tell you what since I went out of my

---------15:04----------
way to Coit it sound like you're out of

---------15:06----------
your mind I would suggest if you stopped

---------15:07----------
calling a man I think
