---------00:00----------
so today we're gonna be starting off

---------00:01----------
with an eight two zero zero zero one 65

---------00:03----------
that doesn't turn on here we go this is

---------00:05----------
a macbook air board and this macbook air

---------00:09----------
board asks that you consider Larry sharp

---------00:11----------
for governor of New York don't delay

---------00:15----------
consider Larry sharp today as you can

---------00:18----------
see when we plug it in we get no light

---------00:20----------
on the charger there's no light in the

---------00:23----------
charger that nothing shows up here no

---------00:26----------
MagSafe light so what is that we need to

---------00:28----------
get a max a flight on a MacBook Air can

---------00:31----------
any of you tell me what's required to

---------00:33----------
get a max a flight on a MacBook Air

---------00:35----------
well the way this works is that the

---------00:37----------
charger is going to talk to the system

---------00:39----------
management controller so let's try and

---------00:41----------
figure out if that's turning on by you

---------00:43----------
heading over to the schematic and the

---------00:45----------
board VPP bunch g3 HOD is created by the

---------00:49----------
is l6 two five nine and that talks to

---------00:53----------
the assistant management controller

---------00:54----------
which talks to the charger if the SMC is

---------00:57----------
on we will get eight point five volts on

---------01:00----------
our pp bus if it is off we will get

---------01:03----------
eight point one volts on our pp bus so

---------01:06----------
what do we get on our pp bus one way to

---------01:09----------
find out let's check our pp bus eight

---------01:18----------
point one seven volts our SMC is not

---------01:23----------
running

---------01:23----------
let's check the chip that's gonna turn

---------01:26----------
on our SMC you 5110

---------01:40----------
NSMC reset is giving us zero volts all

---------01:45----------
right so how's this work what's gonna so

---------01:48----------
PB 3 V 4 2 is going to pull up SMC reset

---------01:54----------
L to make it high on our 5100 so where

---------01:57----------
is our 5100 our 5100 is over here right

---------02:06----------
by this blast of corrosion yeah you have

---------02:19----------
three point four on one side 0 on the

---------02:22----------
other and now we have three point four

---------02:27----------
on both sides after wiping off that

---------02:28----------
corrosion and now we have a light on the

---------02:33----------
charger and now we have fan spin and the

---------02:43----------
MacBook is turning on this is all you

---------02:46----------
have to do to kill a MacBook this is all

---------02:50----------
it takes

---------02:51----------
it's just this teeny tiny little bit of

---------02:54----------
stuff that I could scratch off with the

---------02:57----------
edge of a cheap pair of tweezers this is

---------03:00----------
all it takes to kill a MacBook because

---------03:02----------
there is apps there is zero percent

---------03:04----------
effort put into ensuring that there is

---------03:07----------
any protection against liquid ingress in

---------03:09----------
this machine even though this is

---------03:11----------
something that Lenovo and IBM had come

---------03:13----------
up with over 12 years ago hell if

---------03:16----------
Apple's gonna implement any of these

---------03:17----------
features like having a drainage hole on

---------03:19----------
the machine or tape that goes over the

---------03:21----------
motherboard so that the liquid goes

---------03:23----------
around the motherboard and then into the

---------03:24----------
drainage holes as has been done by other

---------03:26----------
manufacturers and not even patented for

---------03:29----------
over a decade but that's what you get

---------03:32----------
quality think different with that we'll

---------03:35----------
move on to the next board you may want

---------03:36----------
to check out the lenovo x1 carbon or the

---------03:39----------
lenovo thinkpad p50 or any other machine

---------03:41----------
manufactured by people that actually

---------03:43----------
care about the fact that it will last

---------03:44----------
longer than a year so now we're gonna

---------03:47----------
move on to our next machine and go from

---------03:50----------
there

---------03:51----------
yep that's all it takes to kill a Mac

---------03:54----------
look that is all it takes to kill a

---------03:57----------
macbook and you can take a look at this

---------04:00----------
video that I'm gonna link below when I

---------04:02----------
wind up doing the edited version of it

---------04:05----------
for a machine that is able to just take

---------04:08----------
a gallon of water on it and still keep

---------04:10----------
ticking but how does a macbook respond

---------04:15----------
to that that little tiny like baby ant

---------04:19----------
size little bit of blue stuff

---------04:21----------
sure dad I'll give it some flux some

---------04:27----------
flux and some hot air what a piece of

---------04:32----------
 what a Mac what a Mac this is such

---------04:37----------
a Mac if you need miscellaneous items

---------04:40----------
like flux electronics connectors you

---------04:44----------
could check out store awesome group comm

---------04:47----------
stored out Rossmann group comm endorses

---------04:50----------
Larry sharp for governor of New York

---------04:52----------
City and stayed late to say city that

---------04:56----------
was top

---------04:59----------
store dot Rosman group comm hopes that

---------05:02----------
you don't delay but consider Larry shark

---------05:04----------
today
