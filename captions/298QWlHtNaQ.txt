---------00:00----------
since this channel is dedicated to the

---------00:01----------
repair of Apple products and discussing

---------00:03----------
the hardware faults within them a common

---------00:05----------
question that I get is are there any

---------00:07----------
Apple products that are designed that

---------00:09----------
are durable something that's not going

---------00:11----------
to blow within one or two years so today

---------00:13----------
I'd like to go over the one thing within

---------00:16----------
the Apple ecosystem that never ever

---------00:18----------
blows and we're going to be doing this

---------00:21----------
within the context of a board repair

---------00:22----------
video now if you just want to skip ahead

---------00:25----------
and figure out what it is

---------00:26----------
I'll leave something in the description

---------00:27----------
a little hint but I think that you

---------00:29----------
should watch the video rather than just

---------00:31----------
skip ahead to the hints because it's

---------00:33----------
going to be an interesting one so the no

---------00:49----------
back lights likely going to be because

---------00:51----------
of disconnected feedback see this disc

---------00:59----------
this is supposed to connect to this and

---------01:02----------
it's not but I have to connect this to

---------01:11----------
that

---------01:14----------
and you could see where it broke off

---------01:17----------
actually I can make the connection right

---------01:19----------
here I don't even have to run some long

---------01:22----------
convoluted wire

---------01:33----------
all right so that might just do it check

---------01:38----------
that out

---------01:40----------
this needs to know how fast it needs to

---------01:42----------
switch the more it switches the coil to

---------01:44----------
ground the more the coil rages and the

---------01:46----------
more the coil rages the more power you

---------01:48----------
get so it has to see what it's creating

---------01:50----------
so this chip that does the switching has

---------01:52----------
a line called feedback and the feedback

---------01:54----------
is going to be between backlight output

---------01:56----------
which is at the diode

---------01:57----------
bacala to the lp 8550 and that's this

---------02:00----------
little probe point where it says XW 7720

---------02:04----------
so it shows backlight output P pH VSOs W

---------02:09----------
LCD Bickel it is attaching to this

---------02:11----------
little thingy and that thingy it's gonna

---------02:14----------
go to the other side of the board and go

---------02:16----------
onto my LED driver on ball v so what

---------02:19----------
you're seeing over here is the break

---------02:21----------
between backlight output which is uh

---------02:24----------
over here and the via to the other side

---------02:29----------
of the board which is over there so what

---------02:30----------
I did is I ran my my little jumper wire

---------02:34----------
of fire from here to there bada-bing

---------02:40----------
bada-boom and just to give you an idea

---------02:43----------
of the size of that wire let me show you

---------02:46----------
what the tip of my tweezer looks like

---------02:47----------
these are some Dumont 5e tweezers and I

---------02:52----------
don't even know if I can yeah so that's

---------02:57----------
what my tweezer end looks like and

---------03:00----------
that's the size the wire back light

---------03:03----------
voltage is zero fuse voltage is eight

---------03:14----------
voltage into coil point one all right so

---------03:22----------
what's not opening here let's see all

---------03:27----------
right so Q seven seven oh six as a

---------03:29----------
p-channel MOSFET that's going to open

---------03:31----------
when the voltage on pin three is lower

---------03:33----------
than the voltage on pin four

---------03:40----------
we can find that down here so I'm gonna

---------03:42----------
measure pin three as you know that's pin

---------03:47----------
1 pin 3 has 2.77 volts on it pin 4 as

---------03:55----------
point 1 2 volts the back light fuse has

---------03:59----------
eight

---------04:07----------
you

---------04:12----------
okay so it seems like we have a break in

---------04:14----------
the path between the backlight fuse over

---------04:18----------
here and the MOSFET over here so that's

---------04:22----------
the next thing that we're gonna have to

---------04:23----------
observe let's see what that looks like

---------04:25----------
on the board cue 7706 looks sad on the

---------04:30----------
board hey long time no see game boy

---------04:32----------
genius the defuse actually do something

---------04:35----------
no of course the fuse didn't blow Chris

---------04:36----------
long the fuse never blows it's an Apple

---------04:38----------
product what blows is the actual pathway

---------04:41----------
between the fuse and important

---------04:42----------
components because if the fuse was doing

---------04:44----------
its job this would not be an Apple

---------04:46----------
product and it isn't so

---------04:55----------
you

---------04:59----------
I'm probably gonna remove that fuse

---------05:00----------
anyway just cuz it looks like garbage

---------05:02----------
but the fuse itself is not the problem

---------05:04----------
I'm just removing it to make it easier

---------05:06----------
to work in this area sad

---------05:22----------
watch I'll I'll prove it to you that

---------05:24----------
fuse is fine I'm just removing it

---------05:26----------
because it's cosmetically aggravating so

---------05:29----------
resistance measurement that fuse is that

---------05:35----------
fuse is not resisting

---------05:56----------
the transistor was likely good to is

---------05:58----------
just the solder or something had

---------06:02----------
corroded away by it

---------06:03----------
either way the stuff looks like so

---------06:06----------
we're just gonna go in the trash

---------06:07----------
we ran the jumper wire for feedback once

---------06:12----------
we saw that the feedback part was

---------06:13----------
damaged

---------06:14----------
now after that was fixed we turned it on

---------06:16----------
but we still had 0.2 volts back light

---------06:18----------
output zero point 2 instead of aid or 20

---------06:24----------
or 30 means that there's likely a break

---------06:26----------
in the line zero volts would mean blown

---------06:27----------
fuse or the machines telling the

---------06:29----------
backlight not to turn on but point 2

---------06:30----------
volts is not a valid state so we checked

---------06:33----------
and over here we had 0.2 volts so we

---------06:37----------
check back here at the beginning of the

---------06:38----------
circuit and we had 8 point 5 volts so

---------06:41----------
then we checked over here and we had

---------06:43----------
point 2 volts and then I checked here

---------06:44----------
and I had point 2 volts and I checked

---------06:47----------
here and I had point 2 volts and over

---------06:49----------
here I had point 2 volts at that point I

---------06:52----------
know that the issue has to be somewhere

---------06:53----------
between here and here so I measure here

---------06:55----------
and I get eight point five measure here

---------06:58----------
I get point two issue breaking the line

---------07:01----------
over here and when you look at the board

---------07:02----------
right in that section between the fuse

---------07:04----------
and here

---------07:06----------
BAM easily visible that top left pad

---------07:12----------
right over here

---------07:14----------
is the one that is destroyed and it's

---------07:18----------
going to be difficult for us to scrape

---------07:21----------
that off because I have the micro pencil

---------07:23----------
huh on not the standard iron but we'll

---------07:26----------
get it so time to put a little bit of

---------07:33----------
flux

---------07:38----------
a little bit of solder get down tonight

---------08:05----------
and the fuse pad we're also gonna try to

---------08:08----------
get rid of any of the junk and garbage

---------08:10----------
that may be present in there

---------08:28----------
okay we're gonna replace our fuse and

---------08:30----------
then we're gonna replace that transistor

---------08:32----------
and this is gonna be an amazing

---------08:33----------
beautiful lovely board okay we're gonna

---------08:36----------
prepare the board for my transistor next

---------08:38----------
a tiny bit of flux Chris long says Apple

---------08:45----------
make some damn good fuses that's all I'm

---------08:47----------
saying yeah that's a quality fuse it's

---------08:51----------
one of the few things Apple makes that

---------08:53----------
doesn't blow one of the few things Apple

---------08:55----------
makes that doesn't blow our the fuses

---------09:00----------
Apple engineering again what why have

---------09:02----------
the fuse blow and you can just have the

---------09:04----------
pathway between the fuse and the circuit

---------09:06----------
fail the funny thing is in the retina

---------09:07----------
model they had current sensing put in

---------09:09----------
that year and on this machine

---------09:12----------
they actually have current sensing on

---------09:17----------
the board but and they chew end up not

---------09:19----------
using it in the air of this year because

---------09:23----------
if this or the other model the fuse

---------09:25----------
wouldn't blow but you also would have

---------09:26----------
the burn circuit traces because it would

---------09:28----------
shut off the pathway not let anything

---------09:32----------
through

---------09:40----------
yeah I guess

---------09:42----------
I guess like $1,100 for this machine

---------09:45----------
wasn't enough to implement that feature

---------09:49----------
and you got to save that for like for

---------09:51----------
$13.99 once you know I'm saying Chris

---------09:54----------
long is right Apple does make some damn

---------09:56----------
good fuses that's all he's saying he's

---------10:00----------
just complimenting them on the quality

---------10:01----------
of their fuses that's durable stuff

---------10:06----------
right there

---------10:19----------
Apple knows how to make a very durable

---------10:21----------
fuse okay I bet we're gonna have a light

---------10:27----------
now we're gonna get a light you should

---------10:30----------
be excited I'm excited

---------10:39----------
come on Louis needs a new bicycle to

---------10:45----------
replace stolen bicycle Louis doesn't

---------10:49----------
want to take the train anymore train

---------10:52----------
sucks

---------10:56----------
aha there's a light

---------11:01----------
look at that it's an apple it's an apple

---------11:08----------
all right we have an Apple logo so

---------11:12----------
that's that yes in case you are

---------11:16----------
wondering the one thing inside of Apple

---------11:19----------
products that never blows is the

---------11:21----------
backlight fuse what will blow is the

---------11:25----------
screen cable the LCD connector

---------11:27----------
everything in between it but the

---------11:30----------
backlight fuse that is the most durable

---------11:33----------
component in the Apple product when they

---------11:35----------
engineered this device they engineered

---------11:37----------
it with such strong and powerful fuse

---------11:40----------
that it never blew so that's the one

---------11:43----------
component inside your Apple products and

---------11:45----------
you can be guaranteed is never gonna

---------11:46----------
blow the protection circuitry thanks for

---------11:50----------
