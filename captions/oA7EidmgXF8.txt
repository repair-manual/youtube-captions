---------00:00----------
everybody how's it going so today we're

---------00:01----------
going to be working on an a1706 touch

---------00:04----------
bar macbook pro

---------00:05----------
the customer says its laptop's not

---------00:06----------
turning on no power just completely dead

---------00:09----------
was working fine the day before no water

---------00:11----------
damage

---------00:12----------
well we'll be the judge of that now

---------00:14----------
won't we so let's open this thing up

---------00:16----------
and see if this customer is telling the

---------00:18----------
truth

---------00:19----------
so i will open this up and see what it

---------00:21----------
looks like on the inside

---------00:23----------
and then i'll show you and then maybe

---------00:25----------
you can help me fix it

---------00:27----------
runs a business with like 10 people

---------00:28----------
working crewman doesn't own a car

---------00:30----------
that how does that make me poor oh my

---------00:33----------
god

---------00:34----------
my my friend has a car and i can beat

---------00:35----------
him to work on a regular basis i could

---------00:37----------
beat him to work without even trying

---------00:38----------
my friend again the doctor evil genius i

---------00:41----------
[ __ ] you not

---------00:42----------
i was able to beat him to work by about

---------00:44----------
19 seconds and we live in the same area

---------00:46----------
i was able to beat him by about 19

---------00:47----------
seconds and that was when i had an issue

---------00:49----------
with my cassette

---------00:50----------
where it wasn't aligned right so i

---------00:51----------
couldn't use max torque so i was

---------00:53----------
limited in the amount of torque that i

---------00:55----------
could use on the bike

---------00:56----------
which is already a one to three thousand

---------00:58----------
watt device compared to a [ __ ] car

---------01:01----------
and i was still able to beat him no it's

---------01:03----------
not poor lewis for not having a car

---------01:04----------
it's poor the rest of these [ __ ] that

---------01:06----------
are stuck

---------01:08----------
waiting in traffic all day hell having a

---------01:11----------
car

---------01:12----------
is a freaking nightmare it's awful it's

---------01:15----------
absolutely

---------01:15----------
i don't know i would probably lose my

---------01:17----------
mind waiting in new york

---------01:19----------
traffic every single day i would

---------01:21----------
genuinely lose my [ __ ]

---------01:23----------
because when i pass these people and i

---------01:25----------
see like i get to the

---------01:27----------
the front of the line and i see that

---------01:28----------
there's someone like drunkenly falling

---------01:30----------
asleep at the wheel

---------01:31----------
or having an argument with someone or

---------01:32----------
who just doesn't notice that the light

---------01:34----------
is changed

---------01:35----------
and they have their headphones on so

---------01:36----------
they can't even hear the people honking

---------01:37----------
at them

---------01:38----------
like i am not stuck the people that are

---------01:41----------
in cars because

---------01:43----------
they need to they need to ride around in

---------01:45----------
a 3000 pound tank

---------01:47----------
see transporting a 100 pound person

---------01:50----------
should not require a 3000 pound tank

---------01:52----------
like it's a waste of energy

---------01:54----------
and it's also kind of a waste of space

---------01:56----------
it's it's like there are times when

---------01:57----------
that's needed

---------01:58----------
and by all means sure but most of the

---------02:00----------
trips that people make in

---------02:01----------
new york they don't require that you be

---------02:03----------
transported in a 3 000 pound tank it's

---------02:05----------
it's inefficient and it's not even

---------02:07----------
inefficient from the like save the

---------02:08----------
climate planet all that [ __ ]

---------02:10----------
that's one way to look at it it's just

---------02:12----------
fundamentally inefficient in that

---------02:14----------
if there is uh if there is something

---------02:16----------
blocking me ahead

---------02:17----------
i wish to be able to do this but if

---------02:19----------
you're driving in something that's this

---------02:21----------
wide and you have something in front of

---------02:22----------
you you can't really do that and i can

---------02:24----------
and i can see how pissed off and

---------02:26----------
aggravated all the drivers are

---------02:27----------
hong kong and i'm just laughing at him

---------02:30----------
as i'm like yep

---------02:30----------
yeah i'm good i don't care that it's

---------02:32----------
rush hour traffic i'm getting to work in

---------02:34----------
20 minutes

---------02:35----------
i don't care i could i could be leaving

---------02:37----------
the store at 4 45

---------02:38----------
before covid and when i lived in the old

---------02:41----------
store where i was closer i could get

---------02:43----------
home in 11 12 minutes

---------02:44----------
now it takes me about 20 because i'm a

---------02:46----------
little further away but still you get

---------02:47----------
the idea

---------02:48----------
poor these [ __ ] that have to deal with

---------02:49----------
cars it's horrible

---------02:51----------
a lot i think there's going to be a big

---------02:53----------
cultural backlash

---------02:54----------
against that like anybody that wants to

---------02:56----------
speak about

---------02:58----------
different modern forms of transportation

---------03:00----------
and like almost everything now is

---------03:02----------
is political and culture war or [ __ ] and

---------03:04----------
all that crap but

---------03:05----------
i i don't try to to get at people from

---------03:07----------
the the climate

---------03:09----------
the climate how dare you because you

---------03:12----------
know even if they make cogent arguments

---------03:13----------
it just gets people

---------03:14----------
pissed off i just try to say listen man

---------03:17----------
i get to work

---------03:18----------
i i don't know what you're doing but i'm

---------03:20----------
paying a lot less money than you

---------03:21----------
and i'm sitting in a lot less traffic so

---------03:24----------
you want to sit in traffic for 45

---------03:25----------
minutes you'd be my guest i'm going to

---------03:27----------
get to work in 15 minutes

---------03:29----------
no matter what's on the road so that

---------03:31----------
that that's what that's really where i

---------03:32----------
make my sales pitch

---------03:33----------
same thing with veganism you know i'm

---------03:35----------
not going to go up to someone and say

---------03:36----------
how dare

---------03:37----------
you kill them those animals what i do is

---------03:40----------
i just say

---------03:41----------
this is the best burrito in the world

---------03:43----------
with the best sauce in the world try

---------03:44----------
this out by the way you know it's

---------03:46----------
vegetarian that's that's kind of the way

---------03:48----------
you convince people not by shaming them

---------03:50----------
and beating them it's just

---------03:51----------
this is a different way of doing things

---------03:52----------
and by the way i save about five hours a

---------03:54----------
week and

---------03:55----------
not waiting in traffic what do you think

---------03:57----------
it's like oh maybe i'll try that

---------03:59----------
maybe i'll try that all right so on this

---------04:01----------
one so who fry the people best this time

---------04:03----------
so this is a common there's a common

---------04:05----------
place on the all all this board that

---------04:07----------
always winds up getting liquid on it and

---------04:08----------
in this one i don't see a liquid there i

---------04:10----------
see dust

---------04:11----------
so i'm going to that first that

---------04:12----------
typically takes away pp3v3 underscore g3

---------04:14----------
hot

---------04:15----------
so before i even take my multimeter out

---------04:16----------
i want to see if this cap under here is

---------04:18----------
shorted

---------04:18----------
it always is every single time this is

---------04:20----------
in the wiki this is a very common one

---------04:22----------
that you should all be familiar with by

---------04:24----------
now

---------04:24----------
because you are going to see it every

---------04:26----------
day and as you can see

---------04:28----------
it is hiding under there exactly as

---------04:30----------
expected so pp3 underscore g3 hot is a

---------04:33----------
required power rail

---------04:34----------
because that power rail powers the usbc

---------04:37----------
mux chip which is what you see over here

---------04:39----------
the cd3215

---------04:40----------
this chip and that chip needs its pp3 v3

---------04:44----------
g3 high power will work now if this cap

---------04:46----------
shorts the ground

---------04:47----------
then it's going to stop everything from

---------04:50----------
from working because you're not going to

---------04:51----------
have a charger working

---------04:53----------
and that cap always dies i don't know

---------04:56----------
why it could

---------04:56----------
the water always goes there even if it

---------04:59----------
doesn't go anywhere else in the machine

---------05:01----------
but it is a very very common issue and

---------05:03----------
you should you should know to look for

---------05:04----------
this your staff should know to look for

---------05:06----------
this this should be a

---------05:07----------
very common one so i'm just going to

---------05:08----------
bend the shield back a little bit

---------05:11----------
like so because i don't feel like

---------05:15----------
you know i don't want to

---------05:19----------
solder without being able to see what

---------05:21----------
i'm doing so i'm just going to bend the

---------05:22----------
shield

---------05:25----------
i'm probably triggering somebody right

---------05:26----------
now really hard because i'm bending that

---------05:28----------
shield but

---------05:30----------
oh well what are you going to do yes i'm

---------05:33----------
cutting into your little precious

---------05:35----------
macbook

---------05:36----------
deal with it

---------05:46----------
now this is a particularly difficult

---------05:47----------
area to work in because i can't really

---------05:50----------
use hot air

---------05:51----------
because remember you have to remember

---------05:52----------
that there is a under filled chip right

---------05:54----------
over there

---------05:57----------
and if i use hot air over here

---------06:00----------
to remove this or to solder a new one in

---------06:02----------
i'm likely going to wind up screwing up

---------06:06----------
the the cd 3215 and having to re reball

---------06:09----------
it or replace it

---------06:11----------
which means removing all the under fill

---------06:13----------
and that's something that we want to

---------06:14----------
avoid doing because that's a nightmare

---------06:16----------
that's not fun again it's doable you

---------06:20----------
know you should have the skill to do it

---------06:21----------
but just because you have the skill to

---------06:23----------
do something doesn't mean you should

---------06:24----------
actually

---------06:25----------
you know seek to do it you want to try

---------06:27----------
to avoid it

---------06:28----------
doing these those things so i'm going to

---------06:31----------
clear out some of this

---------06:32----------
some of that is dirt some of that is

---------06:34----------
under fill i'm just going to click

---------06:36----------
clear that out so that i have space to

---------06:38----------
solder in

---------06:39----------
remember solder with two ds there's no

---------06:42----------
l in solder

---------06:45----------
don't listen to british and australian

---------06:47----------
people they're lying to you

---------06:49----------
they're lying to you about everything

---------06:57----------
yeah this is pretty nasty

---------07:01----------
this is this is the inside of your

---------07:02----------
standard macbook

---------07:04----------
that's pretty nasty

---------07:14----------
okay

---------07:17----------
it's kind of hard to tell is this moi

---------07:18----------
was the moisture inside of the dust

---------07:21----------
or was the did moisture or did water

---------07:24----------
actually get in here or was it just

---------07:25----------
moist dust that got in there

---------07:28----------
either way that's pretty pretty

---------07:42----------
disgusting

---------07:48----------
now it's again it's going to be fairly

---------07:49----------
difficult to find a way to get in there

---------07:57----------
some flux

---------08:03----------
because nothing is actually going to

---------08:05----------
want to fit in there i could get in

---------08:06----------
there if i remove that capacitor a lot

---------08:08----------
easier

---------08:09----------
because my iron will touch the pad but

---------08:12----------
it's going to touch it very

---------08:13----------
barely it's barely going to touch the

---------08:15----------
pad so i'm not really going to get a lot

---------08:17----------
of heat transfer there

---------08:30----------
now i'm going to take another kappa

---------08:31----------
sitter from another board

---------08:40----------
that still has its capacitor

---------08:44----------
and we're going to put it right over

---------08:46----------
there

---------08:50----------
i might use a little bit of hot air to

---------08:51----------
get in there

---------08:53----------
i don't have the angle to be able to get

---------08:54----------
in there with my my hot tweezers

---------09:00----------
someone says i wish i had a soldering

---------09:01----------
kit like lewis has a sarah kiss rock

---------09:04----------
it's just a basic it's a basic micro

---------09:07----------
pencil iron

---------09:08----------
uh there should be a link in the

---------09:09----------
description down below and my hot air

---------09:11----------
station is

---------09:12----------
the an 862 that i use actually this is

---------09:15----------
the quick 861

---------09:18----------
the other guys use the hat 862 or i use

---------09:20----------
the aton 862 at the other desk when i

---------09:22----------
am showing you employees something you

---------09:24----------
can find all that stuff at

---------09:26----------
store.rosmangroup.com the hot air

---------09:27----------
station

---------09:29----------
all right so now i got to figure out how

---------09:30----------
to get this damp cap in there

---------09:39----------
that's not going to want to fit

---------09:43----------
let me come are you the right one

---------09:52----------
i believe i may be getting trolled

---------10:08----------
yeah i got the wrong one that's too big

---------10:21----------
all right

---------10:31----------
you know what i may cheat and use hot

---------10:32----------
air here

---------10:34----------
i might just cheat and use some hot air

---------10:36----------
but i'm going to lower the temperature

---------10:37----------
and i'm going to cover my cd3215 with a

---------10:39----------
piece of metal

---------10:46----------
i'm also going to cover my my nan chip

---------10:49----------
over there with a piece of metal

---------10:54----------
this is this will work as kind of a heat

---------10:58----------
sink

---------11:22----------
ask dan rossmanngroup.com the backwoods

---------11:26----------
engineer

---------11:32----------
uh not sure

---------11:50----------
uh it may be that we're out of stock of

---------11:52----------
the scratching dents

---------11:54----------
which is a good thing i don't want to

---------11:55----------
have a bunch of damaged stuff but

---------11:59----------
all right now we're going to cool this

---------12:00----------
off really quickly

---------12:03----------
utilizing rapid cool technology i just

---------12:05----------
touched myself with one of the tweezers

---------12:06----------
i was using as a heatsink my god that

---------12:08----------
burns

---------12:09----------
ow how we test ow

---------12:14----------
ow ow

---------12:31----------
ow that's some hot tweezers right there

---------12:36----------
that's what we call hot tweezers

---------12:39----------
i wasn't even trying to give myself an

---------12:41----------
owie test there and i got myself an owie

---------12:43----------
test

---------12:47----------
so i turned my hot air station from 500

---------12:50----------
degrees down to 300 degrees

---------12:52----------
and since the solder on all the chips in

---------12:54----------
the motherboard

---------12:55----------
is lead free and my solder was leaded

---------12:58----------
that ensures that my if as long as i

---------13:00----------
timed it right and i didn't put too much

---------13:01----------
extra

---------13:02----------
time there that it was going to melt my

---------13:06----------
joint into place my joints in a place my

---------13:09----------
component into place

---------13:10----------
before it actually melted anything

---------13:12----------
underneath the chip itself which is a

---------13:13----------
good thing

---------13:15----------
now again if you leave it there too long

---------13:17----------
then you will

---------13:19----------
melt the balls underneath the

---------13:21----------
under-filled ship and have to

---------13:22----------
take the chip off and reball it which is

---------13:24----------
a nightmare and you don't want to do

---------13:25----------
that so

---------13:26----------
which is why i'm not like staying there

---------13:28----------
for a long time

---------13:29----------
as the moment i see that i have even the

---------13:31----------
tiniest bit

---------13:32----------
of zinc the moment i see that's it i'm

---------13:35----------
not staying there and like waiting for

---------13:36----------
the component to move back and forth

---------13:38----------
like over the bga that's not important

---------13:39----------
to me what's important to me there

---------13:41----------
is not the 100 perfect placement of it

---------13:44----------
moment it's in place and it's moved i'm

---------13:46----------
good i don't need to sit there and wait

---------13:47----------
for it to settle what i want is

---------13:49----------
to get that capacitor in place without

---------13:53----------
not without heating the stuff under it

---------13:55----------
or above it so i have my little tweezer

---------13:57----------
in place as a heatsink

---------13:58----------
at the end because i needed to get the

---------14:00----------
iron a little bit closer i moved that

---------14:02----------
away

---------14:02----------
and when i pointed the hot air

---------14:05----------
at the this way i removed the tweezer

---------14:08----------
over here so i could get it in there and

---------14:10----------
i did it really quickly it settled in

---------14:11----------
place and it was good

---------14:13----------
so now we're going to see if we have any

---------14:14----------
change in behavior

---------14:17----------
all right 20 volts 700 milliamps now

---------14:20----------
what i'm curious to see is if it boots

---------14:22----------
i'd like to see a boot

---------14:27----------
the way i would see it boot is i have to

---------14:28----------
move it so that i can show the screen in

---------14:31----------
the camera but i got to do that without

---------14:33----------
unplugging anything

---------14:37----------
as you can see it sees the operating

---------14:39----------
system and is booting into the operating

---------14:41----------
system

---------14:42----------
this is important because remember what

---------14:43----------
i was heating that area that i was

---------14:45----------
heating is

---------14:46----------
right above the nan chip which is the

---------14:48----------
chip that contains your data

---------14:50----------
for the solid state drive so if i had

---------14:54----------
done anything

---------14:55----------
if i had overheated anything over there

---------14:57----------
what you would have seen

---------14:58----------
is a question mark folder because the

---------15:00----------
the data

---------15:01----------
you know as in the operating system

---------15:03----------
would not be there

---------15:06----------
and that is clearly not the case because

---------15:09----------
it is now booting up which is great

---------15:13----------
it's lovely it's booting it's going to

---------15:15----------
boot a little slow because i don't know

---------15:16----------
the battery or the trackpad or any of

---------15:18----------
the sensors plugged in

---------15:19----------
so it's going to it's going to clock

---------15:20----------
itself down but it is booting which

---------15:23----------
means that we did our job

---------15:24----------
let me show you on flex board view what

---------15:27----------
that

---------15:28----------
cap was for and just keep this in mind

---------15:32----------
because that's that's an area that

---------15:34----------
people often neglect to check

---------15:36----------
because it's hidden underneath that

---------15:38----------
shield and since it's hidden underneath

---------15:39----------
that shield

---------15:40----------
you know it's one of those things where

---------15:41----------
it's out of sight out of mind

---------15:44----------
and if it's out of sight adam it's it's

---------15:46----------
not just out of sight and out of mind

---------15:47----------
it's also out of wallet because if you

---------15:48----------
don't find it you're never going to fix

---------15:50----------
it

---------15:51----------
you need to find it and see it in order

---------15:53----------
to fix it so i'm going to load this up

---------15:55----------
on this

---------15:55----------
matic in the board view on the screen

---------15:58----------
and let's

---------15:59----------
get this done so

---------16:03----------
let's get paul daniels of software to

---------16:04----------
show up here we go

---------16:06----------
it's that's not showing up the way i

---------16:09----------
would expect it to but

---------16:11----------
it's not the way it showed up last time

---------16:14----------
paul

---------16:14----------
daniels oh wait

---------16:18----------
here we go that's my fault my bad i

---------16:20----------
always yell at paul when i [ __ ]

---------16:21----------
something

---------16:22----------
up it's not fair there we go

---------16:25----------
all right can i blame paul daniels for

---------16:29----------
linus for nvidia's shitty drivers

---------16:32----------
if i have my chat window over the

---------16:34----------
schematic it does that if i minimize my

---------16:36----------
chat window it doesn't do that it was

---------16:38----------
cute

---------16:38----------
back in 2002 when my geforce 440 mx go

---------16:42----------
and my dell inspirin

---------16:43----------
8200 didn't work perfectly in linux fine

---------16:46----------
it was 2002.

---------16:48----------
then like you know in 2011 and 12 and 13

---------16:51----------
and 14 when it didn't work with nvidia

---------16:53----------
cards okay fine linux system it's 2020

---------16:56----------
nvidia come on just get it together this

---------16:57----------
is a 900

---------16:58----------
graphics card surely you've made enough

---------17:00----------
money that you could put together a

---------17:01----------
linux driver that doesn't suck

---------17:03----------
so let's go over the cap that we

---------17:04----------
replaced so we go over here

---------17:08----------
and hit the pdf button in paul daniels's

---------17:10----------
software

---------17:11----------
and as you can see cb 300 is a cap to

---------17:14----------
ground on pp3 v3 underscore g3 hot pp3

---------17:17----------
v3 underscore

---------17:18----------
g3 hot is going to go here voltage in

---------17:21----------
of the cd3215 cd 3215

---------17:24----------
is as it says over here a usbc port

---------17:26----------
controller this chip is going to

---------17:28----------
communicate with the charger and ask

---------17:30----------
for 20 volts rather than 5 volts

---------17:32----------
remember a usbc charger

---------17:34----------
can put out it can put out 5 volts

---------17:37----------
for a phone it could put out 9 volts for

---------17:40----------
fast charging a phone or it could put

---------17:41----------
out 20 volts

---------17:42----------
for charging a laptop and it needs to

---------17:44----------
negotiate the proper amount of power

---------17:46----------
and if this chip doesn't come on it's

---------17:48----------
not going to do that and for this digit

---------17:50----------
to come on

---------17:50----------
it doesn't need its power now you could

---------17:52----------
see over here if i

---------17:54----------
check out usb cca1 and 2 you can see

---------17:57----------
where it actually speaks to the charge

---------17:59----------
board directly

---------18:00----------
so this is whoa

---------18:04----------
oh you're not showing this board view

---------18:06----------
are you

---------18:08----------
paul daniels

---------18:15----------
no okay so you didn't see me hit the pdf

---------18:17----------
button anyway so i

---------18:18----------
you hit the pd i hit the pdf button here

---------18:20----------
to show the capacitor uh this is

---------18:22----------
a different board view is showing i i

---------18:23----------
blame paul daniels for my mistake he's

---------18:25----------
probably used to that by now

---------18:26----------
i'm sorry paul if i move over here and

---------18:29----------
this is the cd3215 this is the usbc mux

---------18:33----------
you can see that it goes directly to

---------18:35----------
where the charge port plugs into the

---------18:36----------
computer

---------18:37----------
that is over here also you could see

---------18:39----------
that it finally finished booting which

---------18:40----------
means that the nand is not damaged

---------18:42----------
so this is the charge port itself

---------18:46----------
and the cd3215 is going to communicate

---------18:48----------
with the charger and ask for its full 20

---------18:50----------
volts

---------18:51----------
but it needs to be powered to do that

---------18:53----------
and pp3 g3 hot is the power rail that it

---------18:55----------
needs

---------18:56----------
and that was short at the ground because

---------18:57----------
this cap over here got corroded

---------18:59----------
this is a very very common corrode cap

---------19:01----------
and again i keep doing

---------19:03----------
videos on this to hammer at home because

---------19:05----------
there's there's a lot of people that

---------19:06----------
miss that little area

---------19:08----------
and missing that little area is going to

---------19:10----------
cost your customer

---------19:11----------
you know a lot of money it's going to

---------19:12----------
cost you a lot of money and miss revenue

---------19:14----------
and it it's right there so make sure

---------19:16----------
that you check that area

---------19:17----------
if you have a pp3p3 underscore g3 hot

---------19:20----------
short it may even be difficult to see on

---------19:22----------
a thermal camera because you have that

---------19:24----------
overarching that metal shield

---------19:27----------
that is right by the nand which is right

---------19:30----------
under the cap

---------19:31----------
and typically the metal shields trick

---------19:33----------
the thermal camera and

---------19:34----------
it just it becomes bad so that's about

---------19:37----------
it for today

---------19:38----------
and as always i hope you learned

---------19:39----------
something i'll see you all in the next

---------19:40----------
video

---------19:41----------
bye now by the way uh the wiki is now

---------19:44----------
been

---------19:44----------
upgraded it features uh three anti-spam

---------19:48----------
plugins that i recently installed so

---------19:50----------
that my site is not going to be filled

---------19:52----------
with a bunch of [ __ ] steroid drug

---------19:55----------
hooker gambling documents anymore i am

---------19:59----------
continuing to add to this wiki here

---------20:01----------
i'm going to continue putting work into

---------20:03----------
it you can just click troubleshooting

---------20:04----------
guides i have a visual inspection

---------20:06----------
guide if let's say you're having a

---------20:08----------
problem with this particular model

---------20:09----------
computer

---------20:09----------
you can just go here you can click that

---------20:12----------
model computer

---------20:13----------
and it gives you a detailed list of all

---------20:15----------
the things that can go wrong

---------20:17----------
it'll even tell you you know if let's

---------20:19----------
say charger stuck at 5 volts

---------20:21----------
instead of 20 volts it will tell you

---------20:24----------
corroded ldo cap for this

---------20:26----------
you know i'm actually going to update

---------20:27----------
that right now to say cb 300

---------20:29----------
i believe it does say cb 300 over here

---------20:31----------
yeah pp3 short at the ground cp300

---------20:33----------
corroded

---------20:34----------
but you can see it look closely i'm

---------20:36----------
putting all of my solutions here so all

---------20:38----------
the stuff that is already in my head

---------20:40----------
or my staff's head i don't want it to

---------20:42----------
just remain there i want it to be

---------20:44----------
available for as many people to see as

---------20:45----------
humanly possible so that more people can

---------20:47----------
get involved in the repair industry

---------20:49----------
more people can save apple customers

---------20:50----------
money and uh you know

---------20:52----------
more people can kind of take part in

---------20:56----------
this hobby that i kind of

---------20:57----------
enjoy again so that's it for today and

---------20:59----------
i'll see you all in the next video

---------21:01----------
bye now
