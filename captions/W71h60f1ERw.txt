---------00:00----------
all right so this board is not charging

---------00:01----------
a battery if I plug in a charger cable

---------00:06----------
there's no light so in order to get a

---------00:07----------
green light in the charger this is the

---------00:09----------
circuit that's got to start working this

---------00:11----------
circuit is going to allow the adapter

---------00:13----------
sense line of the charger to talk to the

---------00:15----------
SMC via this one wire line so this chip

---------00:18----------
over here is the system management

---------00:20----------
controller and this needs to talk to the

---------00:23----------
SMC in order for the charger to turn on

---------00:25----------
this is about a 3 volt data line the

---------00:27----------
charger has the 3 volt data line and the

---------00:29----------
18 volt power line but a lot of people

---------00:30----------
will do while they're drunk is they'll

---------00:32----------
do something where they're trying to

---------00:33----------
plug it in and they'll be the well and

---------00:37----------
then it'll wind up shorting the 18 volt

---------00:39----------
charger line to the 3 volt data line so

---------00:42----------
the reason that we've got this chip over

---------00:44----------
here is this chip is going to keep the

---------00:46----------
18 volts from going to the SMC and

---------00:48----------
frying the SMC for this chip to work it

---------00:51----------
has to be getting power on its VCC pin

---------00:52----------
from this chip and for this chip to work

---------00:54----------
it needs to be being powered on with PP

---------00:56----------
3 V 4 2 and it needs to be getting SMC

---------00:58----------
bc AC ok this logic gate will allow 3.42

---------01:00----------
volts to go through if sm c bc AC ok is

---------01:04----------
present so the first power rail that we

---------01:05----------
need before anything will turn on here

---------01:07----------
is pp 3 V 4 to underscore G 3 ha and

---------01:09----------
that power rail is created conveniently

---------01:11----------
down here by u 6990

---------01:16----------
so let's just take a look and see what

---------01:18----------
that looks like you'll see that it looks

---------01:20----------
like a complete disgusting wreck first

---------01:23----------
thing I'm gonna do is look at the stuff

---------01:25----------
that's corroded and try to match up what

---------01:27----------
it is now this capacitor over here see

---------01:29----------
6990 is this one and you can see that

---------01:31----------
the edge on it is really nasty the

---------01:33----------
reason that I can tell is instead of

---------01:35----------
having two silver edges like the nice

---------01:37----------
components that is a silver edge and

---------01:38----------
this edge is kind of all brown gray

---------01:41----------
blacked out and it's it's kind of junky

---------01:44----------
so see 6990 is one of the capacitors on

---------01:47----------
the input line

---------01:49----------
so this is where the 18 volts from the

---------01:50----------
charger or the 12 0.6 volts from the

---------01:53----------
battery is going to enter the input of

---------01:55----------
you 6990 which is going to take 18 volts

---------01:58----------
from the charger and turn it into 3.42

---------02:00----------
volts or it's gonna take the 12 point 6

---------02:02----------
volts from the battery ignore the Apple

---------02:03----------
typo here of 18 point 5 volts one of

---------02:05----------
their authorized technicians type that

---------02:07----------
in wrong it's gonna take that 12 point 6

---------02:09----------
volts from the battery and turn it into

---------02:10----------
3.42 volts if this capacitor is

---------02:12----------
short-circuited to ground that means

---------02:14----------
that this input line is not going to

---------02:16----------
work and my charger is not going to turn

---------02:17----------
on to work so the first thing I'm gonna

---------02:19----------
do is see if that's the case so we're

---------02:21----------
gonna see what the resistance is to

---------02:23----------
ground over here so put the black probe

---------02:25----------
on ground and this probe over here and

---------02:26----------
as you can see we have 1.4 ohms to

---------02:28----------
ground which means there is a shorter

---------02:30----------
ground on the input of the pp3 before to

---------02:32----------
line I'm gonna take a wild guess this

---------02:33----------
capacitor is one of the offenders and

---------02:35----------
you can see that it chips off very

---------02:36----------
easily because here at the inside of it

---------02:38----------
looks like it's pretty cool stuff never

---------02:40----------
seen the inside of a capacitor before

---------02:45----------
gross my tweezers are kind of nasty eyes

---------02:50----------
broken looking so I'm gonna remove that

---------02:53----------
stuff at the hot air station we're just

---------02:54----------
gonna jump all that get rid of all that

---------02:57----------
junk in the board I'm gonna cover this

---------02:59----------
keyboard backlight connected over here

---------03:01----------
is that keyboard backlight connector is

---------03:03----------
gonna get burned if I don't cover it

---------03:04----------
with something

---------03:07----------
now even though that chip may actually

---------03:09----------
be good I'm not gonna trust that it is

---------03:12----------
we're gonna take that off and we're

---------03:15----------
gonna take this little capacitor off as

---------03:16----------
well this pad over here looks completely

---------03:20----------
gone done for so I'm gonna scrape it a

---------03:22----------
little and see if there's anything under

---------03:24----------
there that I can solder to do the same

---------03:27----------
thing on this other side

---------03:53----------
I've also got to get myself a new chip

---------03:55----------
this board uses an LT 3470 AED shorter

---------04:01----------
Ross believe calm as chips for all

---------04:03----------
MacBook products and they're arranged by

---------04:06----------
the board model number by the model of

---------04:07----------
your machine you can even just search up

---------04:09----------
here use 6990 and we'll give you a list

---------04:12----------
of chips that are you 6990 or you can

---------04:15----------
check out by the model number of the

---------04:16----------
chip it will give you a detailed

---------04:19----------
description of what these things are for

---------04:21----------
don't delay by today yep we're just

---------04:27----------
gonna clean that area up a little bit

---------04:28----------
before putting replacement part you got

---------04:31----------
our pads redone then add some solder to

---------04:33----------
those new paths

---------04:34----------
it's gonna be a beautiful board

---------04:49----------
[Music]

---------04:50----------
check that out that area that was all

---------04:54----------
rusted away is now a nice little solder

---------04:57----------
pit and the reason I'm moving back and

---------05:00----------
forth is because if there's any

---------05:01----------
corrosion or any kind of junk left on

---------05:03----------
the pads I want it all to get stuck on

---------05:05----------
my iron rather than to stay on the board

---------05:07----------
there's a strategy to that alright time

---------05:10----------
to get this Mac turned into a PC

---------05:16----------
returning this Mac into a PC according

---------05:23----------
to the lobbyist that's folk for the

---------05:26----------
assembly person that I spoke to in 2015

---------05:31----------
beautiful

---------05:38----------
all right here we got a little solder

---------05:39----------
ball jump out there this makes we ran

---------05:44----------
out of there which is why those

---------05:45----------
joints look the way they do flux makes

---------05:48----------
everything better

---------05:49----------
my connector right next door actually

---------05:50----------
came out pretty good covering the

---------05:52----------
connector with a small metal shield that

---------05:54----------
came out of an iPhone was a good idea so

---------05:56----------
we plug in the charger and it looks like

---------05:58----------
we've still got nothing that we're gonna

---------05:59----------
go back to the scene of the crime so

---------06:01----------
where we're supposed to be getting 18

---------06:02----------
volts we're getting point 5 ah yes

---------06:05----------
because if there was a short-circuit

---------06:06----------
over here these two resistors that act

---------06:08----------
as fuses would have blown in our 70 20

---------06:10----------
and our seven zero zero five these to

---------06:12----------
act as fuses on the input of the circuit

---------06:15----------
so our 69 20 and our 6905 are here these

---------06:18----------
acts as a fuse between the charger and

---------06:20----------
the input of the pp 3 V 4 2 circuit and

---------06:22----------
the battery in the input of the pp 3 V 4

---------06:24----------
2 circuit and since C 6990 was

---------06:26----------
short-circuited to ground C 6990 would

---------06:29----------
have sent all the electricity from the

---------06:32----------
charger to ground which would have blown

---------06:33----------
this resistor that's acting as a fuse on

---------06:35----------
the input line and you can see that our

---------06:37----------
69 20 is here our 6905 is here if I just

---------06:40----------
go straight into microscope only view I

---------06:42----------
don't need the multimeter to show you

---------06:44----------
that these two look absolutely destroyed

---------06:46----------
that's this and this so we're gonna pop

---------06:51----------
those off and after we pop those off it

---------06:53----------
should work okay I don't want to melt

---------06:55----------
the charging connector which is right

---------06:57----------
above it so to be careful here I'm gonna

---------06:59----------
put my shield again all right so that

---------07:02----------
goes and this actually broke in half Wow

---------07:05----------
I was really damaged

---------07:39----------
[Music]

---------07:43----------
okay we're gonna give the board a second

---------07:45----------
to cool off and after that plug it in

---------07:46----------
and it'll probably work beautifully

---------07:50----------
what are you the state Attorney General

---------07:53----------
[Laughter]

---------07:58----------
aren't you

---------07:59----------
[Music]

---------08:03----------
check that out and that's beautiful

---------08:11----------
it's beautiful absolutely beautiful that

---------08:15----------
is a working board and that is how he

---------08:17----------
fixed the eight to zero 34 62 and it's

---------08:20----------
not charging 99% of the time your

---------08:22----------
corrosion is gonna be in the same spot

---------08:23----------
right down there you need help with any

---------08:25----------
